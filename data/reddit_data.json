It has also led me to wonder about the future of government in Singapore, and whether the current system is sustainable.\n\nThe Singapore government is transparent only when it wants to be (kudos to daily covid status updates, regular press conferences, and announcements), but the operative keyphrase is \"wants to be\". We don't have freedom of information legislation, so we are kept in the dark about a lot of things. The recent fiasco about POFMA 10m population has also shown that non-information and non-transparency is politically expedient, especially when dual-wielded with the weaponized POFMA.\n\nIn terms of accountability, we have seen how PAP MPs broke social distancing rules on a walkabout with absolutely no consequences. When a  similar incident occurred in NZ, the minister was demoted publicly by  the prime minister. We have witnessed a meteoric explosion of covid cases in foreign worker dormitories, with absolutely no consequences, and even an infuriating \"but no worker himself has demanded an apology\" statement from the individual who is most responsible for it. In New Zealand, the responsible minister apologized for 2 new cases. From what I observe on social media and of friends around me, we are maddened, but also maddeningly resigned. In a democracy, the electorate should be electing politicians to serve them; in Singapore, it feels like we are powerless subjects of an all-powerful political institution who grants us limited concessions and freedoms at their pleasure. \n\nEven constitutional guarantees are not immutable. Our omnipotent political masters have -- just like that, with","8":"Hi guys, did anyone experience this before moving in together with your s\/o? \n\nWhen I was living w my parents, I rarely fall ill (6months once kind), but ever since I've moved in with my partner, I've been falling ill every 2-3months with some degree of flu\/stomach issues. \n\nMy hygiene has been consistent before and after moving (I wipe down my phone and bottle with alcohol swabs\/wipes after work\/gym, I wash my hands frequently cause Healthcare worker etc). \n\nMy partner also has decent levels of hygiene albeit not to my extent, So I doubt it's her that's infecting me. \n\nJust wondering if yall have experienced this before?

They have tried some solutions (for the NEL), but it's far from enough compared to **infrastructure improvements made directly to the lines**. Without their acknowledgement or action, this problem will only worsen as Singapore (and especially the NE region) densifies.\n\nLet me explain everything in that above statement:\n\n# 1. Why are these 2 lines in particular the most acutely overcrowded?\n\nIt may come as no surprise to those who commute during the peak using these 2 lines, but waiting 3 or 4 trains has become the norm at certain stations like one-north, Buona Vista, MacPherson, Tai Seng, Hougang, Kovan and Little India. Even barring that, CCL and NEL trains are usually significantly more crowded than their counterparts on other mature lines NSL and EWL. \n\nAs it stands, the NEL is the only line to serve the (now) ultra-dense districts of Sengkang and Punggol. Both have grown to be significantly more dense than the town planners could have ever hoped for (just look at Waterway Point on any day, really), causing the NEL to exceed ridership forecasts by large margins every year. And with new districts like Northshore, Fernvale or even Buangkok Cres coming up over the next few years, ridership is only set to increase by that much more.\n\nThe CCL really just has 1 major flaw - it is a 3 car line that serves districts that deserve 6 car trains. Areas like one-north, Science Park\/NUS, Tai Seng and even National Stadium are major commercial trip generators which have progressively built up since the opening of the CCL and are continuing to be built today, causing crowding to slowly build and reach the levels that we are at today. This is without even including the connectivity role the CCL plays, being basically the only option for trips from the west (Tuas\/Jurong industrial areas) and southeast (Paya Lebar,","77":"The fact is LKY is a great scholar (double first no less) and being one of the key architects (the chief architect is arguably the British Civil Service system) of our government, he naturally favored academically smart people.

The scholarship system is a key systemic structure of how Singapore works today, with a significant portion of the cabinet, key government appointment holders and stats board CEOs being a result of this system. But does it work?\n\nHere is my understanding. Correct me if i am wrong. \n\na.

Such feeder services typically serve the bus interchange \/ town centre bus stop twice along their journeys, functioning as both a feeder service between neighbourhood(s) and the town centre, and connecting different neighbourhoods within a town together. There are currently 13 dual loop feeder services operating in Ang Mo Kio (265, 268), Bedok (222), Choa Chu Kang (307), Pasir Ris (358, 359), Tampines (291, 293), Woodlands (911, 912, 913) and Yishun (811, 812).\n\nUpdate (26\/1\/2023): Only feeder services that were integrated from 2 separate feeder services between 1996 & 1997, as well as those indicated as Townlink by SBS\/SBST or Intra-Town by TIBS, are considered dual loop feeder services. While there are other feeder services such as 228, 229, 231, 232, 235, 240, 243, 282, 298, 315, 325, 372, 381, 410, 800, 807, 913M & 941 that provide direct links between 2 or more neighbourhoods in an estate, they will NOT be considered as dual loop feeder services for this discussion.\n\nIn old newspaper archives, the launch of Townlink\/Intra-Town services were marketed by SBS\/TIBS to \"improve intra-town links between neighbourhoods within an estate\" and \"reducing the hassle of transferring between buses to travel between neighbourhoods\". Some incentives, such as cheaper fares compared to transferring between 2 feeder buses, and the deployment of air-con buses (at a time when feeder services exclusively used non-air-con buses), were also promoted in these articles, both of which have become obsolete with the launch of distance fares in 2010 and a fully air-con bus fleet fr","85":"","97":"I suppose this is more of a rant than a discussion.

Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out \u201csorry sorry\u201d as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number.

Not just because of the number of people, but also because it\u2019s quite old with narrow platforms that can\u2019t barely fit the commuters using the station\n- East is planned to have 4 lines to outside the region, including 3 that go directly to the CBD. West has only 1\n\nHowever, instead of creating an alternative route to the CBD, Science Park and other business centers, the JR line will essentially route everyone in the West to Jurong East. Even to take the Cross Island line you need to go to Jurong East and then change again at Clementi. The JR line connects to Chua Chu Kang, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful as you need to transverse the whole Bukit Panjang LRT to transfer to Downtown Line. So you have no choice but to transfer from red line to green line via\u2026 Jurong East.\n\nI know that the government planned to create a new CBD in Jurong area, but now that seems unlikely with the HSR cancellation. And even if it will eventually happen, there is no way the 100s of thousands of people who will soon be living in Tengah and Jurong will be all working in the West.\n\nI am missing something?

More information can be found [here](https:\/\/mothership.sg\/2016\/07\/we-summarise-wth-is-going-on-with-mrt-train-cars-being-shipped-back-to-china\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.factwire.org\/single-post\/2016\/07\/05\/China-manufacturer-for-MTR-secretly-recalls-35-Singapore-subway-trains-after-cracks-found) and [here](https:\/\/www.theonlinecitizen.com\/2016\/07\/05\/did-smrt-and-lta-hide-defects-of-china-manufactured-trains\/) and [here](http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/transport\/china-made-mrt-trains-sent-back-to-fix-defects). Not only that, the CRRC Sifang China made trains also have a whole other host of problems, such as battery boxes busting, and faulty STARiS displays (the blinking LED line maps you see), among others. SMRT has even suspected that they were the cause of the major train disruptions in 2011.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith this in mind, you would think that LTA would never choose Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CRRC Sifang again. **That's where you're wrong!**. LTA has picked the consortium not once, but **three** more times even after knowing about the faults. That's for the C151B, C151C and CT251 contracts. It is more than likely that they will pick Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CRRC Sifang again. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet'","145":"","146":"**Credits: https:\/\/landtransportguru.net\/distance-based-fares\/ You can read about this in more detail there.**\n\nOur buses and trains currently operate using distance-based fares, based on what is shown [here](https:\/\/www.lta.gov.sg\/content\/dam\/ltagov\/img\/map\/bus\/fare-table.pdf).\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the fares don\u2019t actually start at $0.00; for example, an adult starting his trip will incur a $0.92 \u201cstarting fare\u201d just by tapping in.\n\nHowever, most trips consist of more than 1 bus\/train ride. As such, LTA laid out a few rules for transfers between rides; by following these rules, the next bus\/train ride can be considered a continuation of the trip, with the total distance added up for the final fare. If the rules are broken, the tap-in will be considered a new trip, hence re-incurring the starting fare.\n\nThe transfer rules are as follows:\n1) *A total of 5 transfers can be made in a single trip. Each transfer (i.e. the time between a tap-out and the next tap-in) must be within 45 minutes.* This gives a total of 6 separate bus\/train rides per trip. However, this does not apply to transfers between train stations (see point 4).\n\n2) *The time between the first and last tap-in must be less than 2 hours.* The time of the last tap-out doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n3) *The same bus service number cannot be taken consecutively.* However, it **can** be taken non-consecutively e.g. with a ride on a train or even on another bus service in between.\n\n4) *Transfers directly between different train stations are allowed, but must be made within 15 minutes.*\n\n5) *No tapping out and in at the same train station*. The only exceptions are at stations with unpaid links between lines (e.g. Tampines, Newton); for these cases, the transfer must be made within 15 minutes.\n\nSo, by keeping within the rules, we can try to keep within a single trip, such as when we are doing short trips for quick errands. This allows us to incur the starting fare only once.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For starters, I believe the 45-minut","147":"","148":"","149":"**UPDATE:** \n\noBike was reported to be undergoing liquidated a few hours after my post. Most things within my post are still relevant. My personal course of action from handling similar cases - I personally contacted my credit card company you used to pay the deposit to initiate the chargeback process on the grounds of services not provided. Still, it may be for naught because the company have not have assets left to pay creditors, and I have no knowledge of how chargeback claims are construed, but it MAY be that if you go through the chargeback process, the credit card and thus merchant bank's obligation to refund your money may rank you higher in the list of creditors (since the Bank will be the entity which is recovering the sum instead of you as an individual consumer).\n\nTLDR: \n\noBike leaving, T&C with consumers states that can unilaterally convert your deposit into sVIP membership. \n\noBike corporate structure and the operation of company law may mean that oBike is not obliged to refund its consumers. \n\nNo legal resource as no governmental agency oversight (CASE is a NGO), and small quantum of claim $49 makes it unlikely for anyone to pursue a legal action. \n\nEdit: regulatory recourse may be available under the The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act - see last paragraph!\n\nWarning and disclaimer: Wall of text.

Others have their refund request pending for over a month.\n\n**LTA pushes responsibility onto CASE, a NGO with no ","152":"In Melbourne, where I am from, it is an offence for a taxi driver to cherry-pick fares. Here in Singapore, it seems an acceptable practice.\n\nLines and lines of taxi drivers last Friday night kept passing. Forty five minutes, and I counted (guestimated) 55 cabs that slowed down, asked where we were going, and then sped off. Finally, we had to resort to bribery \"we will give you extra money if you take us, please, no one is stopping\",a nd only then did he do it grudlgingly, and he was apparently going the same way as us as wel!! (He was going to Pasir Ris, we were going to Geylang - its on the fxn way, in the same direction, dude!)\n\nBegging the whole \"Change of shift, must get home to family\"  - and \"not going that way\" or just simply speeding away when the fare isnt to their liking is bullshit - oh sorry, not going *your* way? huh? Im not a freakin hitchhiker trying to bum a lift, Im going to pay you for your damn service. \n\nNowhere in Singapore is far away. Nowhere is more than an hours drive (and thats going one end to the other!). There is abslutely fkn nowhere that is \"inconvenient\" for the driver to take a passenger.\n\nNowhere else in the world have I seen this, and damn, I have traveled. As i mentioned, its even actually against the law for taxis to do this in Australia. Ive had better taxi service in run down twenty year old cars in Guatemala than I have had here.\n\nIn Singapore, its just not about where you want to go - its about where they want to go, and thats plain bullshit -allowing drivers to do this without repercussion is the mark of a broken system, whereby the public that they are supposed to be servicing is put second to the driver and his convenience and needs.\n\nHow often does this happen to you? How do you feel about it? would it be better if laws were put in place to stop taxi drivers doing this? Would it ever happen (doubtful in Sg, in my mind)?\n\nThe SG taxi system is utterly broken - discuss.\n\n\/endrant\n\n**tl;dr - Singapore taxis fkn suck and they","154":"","159":"","168":"So, \/u\/majoshticbeast recently posted a London underground rendition of our trusty system map, and I noticed that one of the design considerations was to add \"OSI\"s onto the map. \n\nAlso, people frequently rant about the DTL loop, not knowing that they can simply tap out and tap back in, and get charged the same fare.\n\nIn 2018, in response to the huge loop that the DTL makes, the LTA (finally) decided to allow transfers between MRT lines without needing a bus ride in between, so below are some of what I feel are the most useful MRT line to MRT line interchanges that you can make within the (15min) time limit, and what interchanges to avoid (even though some maps show it as possible) so as not to risk getting charged more for 2 rides.\n\n* Rochor to Jalan Besar\n\nTransferring from DTL2 to DTL3 is one of the biggest timesavers, as it takes at least 15mins to travel that loop on a train. Rochor to Jalan Besar is the nearest 2 stations, which almost guarantees you a transfer within the time limit. Transfers to avoid: Litttle India to Jalan Besar, Rochor to Bencoolen\n\n* Esplanade to City Hall\n\nEasily the most useful travel hack for westerners heading to the sports hub\/golden mile, as it avoids the mess that is Dhoby Ghaut. This transfer can actually be accomplished within 5mins when the right path is used (via Raffles City), avoiding the labyrinth of Citylink Mall. Transfers to avoid: Esplanade to Bugis, Bras Basah to Bugis\n\n* Downtown to Marina Bay \/ Raffles Place\n\nFor workers who need to get between the Downtown Line and the NSL\/TEL, Downtown is the best station to make the transfer. Typically, Marina Bay is fine for both lines. However if you're using the NSL and it's a hot day you can also opt to use Raffles Place instead as it has an aircon linkway. Transfers to avoid: Chinatown to Raffles Place.\n\n* Dhoby Ghaut to Bencoolen \/ Little India to Jalan Besar\n\nBoth are about the same distance from each other and allow for a seamless transfer between the NEL and DTL.

I should be asleep but I can\u2019t seem to.\n\nI alighted at Jln Kayu today about 6pm to walk home and barely 30s later, there were brakes screeching. When I turned back for a look, two people were on the ground, one on the road and another on the grass patch by the sidewalk. A car had hit two pedestrians crossing the road, windshield had a large spiderweb crack, the person on the road (a malay lady) kinda sat up and slowly moved herself to the kerb. The one on the grass wasn\u2019t moving and ngl I feared for the worst until i saw the person stir a bit.\n\nI called 995 after freezing for a bit, tried to give the location of the accident and they sent traffic police and an ambulance. Another uncle closer to the victims was on the phone with either 995 or traffic police too. The lady was still on the kerb, but she had to move as the driver of the car was moving it to a small parking area on the side of the road (traffic only has 1 lane per direction at J. kayu, and other drivers had to drive past in the other lane). \n\nAnother malay auntie and I helped her to the kerb, where she sat\/leaned against a fire hydrant. The other person involved was a kid, a young malay boy. I believe he was the one who took the brunt of the impact, considering he was flung onto the grass. The pedestrians nearby came over and soothed him, made sure he didn\u2019t move his head in case of a neck injury. Since there were more than enough people attending to the boy, I went to the lady instead and checked on her. Her lips were very pale and almost white, and she was giddy (probably in shock). I talked to her for a bit and convinced her to sit down on the ground as I was genuinely afraid she would pass out. The same malay auntie who helped earlier came back with a pack of lemon tea for her, which appeared to help.\n\nAfter the ambulance\/traffic police came, the EMTs took the boy to KKH with a","175":"To make it easier for everyone to see that the Government had really been taking rather constructive steps prior to the PMD ban, I've put together the entire timeline of all the actions and their respective news articles to give a complete idea on what had been going on prior to the ban.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**======= 2016 ========**\n\n**April**\n\nAnnoucement (LTA): Safe riding campaign launched.\n\n[https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/lta-launches-campaign-promote-safe-riding-habits](https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/lta-launches-campaign-promote-safe-riding-habits)\n\nAnnoucement (LTA): Enforcement against errant cyclists and PMD users to be stepped up\n\n[https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/enforcement-against-errant-cyclists-and-pmd-users-be-stepped](https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/enforcement-against-errant-cyclists-and-pmd-users-be-stepped)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**May**\n\nNews: Team of Active Mobility Enforcement Officers dispatched to catch errant riders.\n\n[https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/speed-guns-and-foldable-bikes-new-lta-team-ensure-safe-sharing-paths](https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/speed-guns-and-foldable-bikes-new-lta-team-ensure-safe-sharing-paths)\n\n[https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/transport\/new-lta-unit-to-ensure-safe-riding-on-footpaths](https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/transport\/new-lta-unit-to-ensure-safe-riding-on-footpaths)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**November**\n\nLaw: Active Mobility Act bill first introduced in Parliament\n\n[https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/penalties-for-errant-pmd-users-and-sellers-in-proposed-law](https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/penalties-for-errant-pmd-users-and-sellers-in-proposed-law)\n\n[https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/laws-governing-use-e-bikes-mobility-devices-pathways-tabled](https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/laws-governing-use-e-bikes-mobility-devices-pathways-tabled)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**======= 2017 ========**\n\n**January**\n\nAnnoucement (LTA): New legislation passed (Active Mobility Act). \\*Act comes into forc","177":"Have you come across these ads online in the past few months?

While I too feel that Singapore drivers are getting less patient, more aggressive and often distracted, driving is still one of my favorite activities and I am here to share some tips for the less happy drivers. \n\n**Pre-drive routine**: You perceive the world very differently depending on your mood, you create your own reality. Here is my pre-drive routine. After starting the engine, just take 3 slow and deep breaths. Notice what your mood is, how do you feel, remind yourself where you are going and if you are unfamiliar with the route, take the time to go through google map's turn by turn direction. Know that along the way, you WILL encounter kind drivers that you don't notice, as well as assholes that will make their ass-holiness known.\n\n**Game plan**: Have a set of \"mental game plan\" for common situations. What works for me is the following. I will always give way to cars who signal their intentions in advance, I will never tailgate, I will never use my horn in anger or act due to anger, I will always show gratitude to kind drivers by waving or signaling with a quick \"hazard light thanks\", I will never DUI or drive tired, I will never use my phone while driving etc.\n\n**When encountering assholes**: Assholes always seem to pop up suddenly without any warning. Thanks to your pre-drive routine, you would have been more vigilant in expecting them to show up. When I jump scare you at night, you get a rude shock. But if I tell you I will jump scare you when you are otw home later, you might still get shocked but much less right?\n\nFirst thing is be safe and take immediate defensive actions such as e-braking and creating a larger safety distance etc, basics that you already know from passing TP isn't it.\n\nAt the same time, take a deep breath and focus on what you are feeling. Don't judge the situation, it is what it is. That asshole probably didn't wake up in the morning hunting you do","273":"You came off at the bus stop I was waiting at with a purple shirt.

Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.\n\nConsequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.\n\nIt controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.\n\nFirstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and","275":"","276":"","278":"","281":"","288":"i (f26) have never been in a relationship, never been intimate w anyone, never even held hands romantically w anyone. i don\u2019t think anyone has had a crush on me before too, neither has anyone ever developed any mild romantic feelings for me?\n\ni\u2019m curious to know if there are more people in my situation than i might think? \ud83e\udd14 ","293":"I\u2019ll go first\u2026\n\nI wish we normalise not being ambitious.

There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form \"sucks\" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it's the case and suggest possible remedies.

There were even fewer regarding SSDC, which is more ulu than the 2 other driving centers. Thus, I promised myself to the higher powers in the world that when I pass the test, I will give back to society and write an updated guide as of December 2020 about what is the current situation like. Three things to note: First, there were still many changes and updates even during my 3.5 months journey the driving school, and you should expect many more to come. Secondly, this is after COVID circuit breaker era, so to the future you who are reading this, hopefully, the pandemic is over and there may be changes, but changes in this aspect should be unimportant. The third thing, I have coordination issues, which made my driving journey a lot more difficult, just a little something to take into consideration when listening to my story. Heads up, getting a license in Singapore is filled with LOTS OF hassle, so be prepared.

But, as big of a problem as it is in this perspective, why are you going after *everyone* who may be falsely accusing? Ask yourself about wider systems at large. Did the court need to release the accused's name? Did the media **have** to dart straight to the doctor's employer before any judgement was given? Did the media need to put their name out for trial before any verdict was given? Why is the justice system set up to serve punishment and violence, which can enable false accusations even more?

The instructions he gave were vague, and I had to infer what he meant or derive the correct method from which technique you were using when you weren't scolded by him. His words were slurred and difficult to understand. Sometimes, he may even give the wrong instruction and blame me for it. On the day of my 2nd TP test (failed the 1st with him), he asked me to U-turn at a point where I was quite sure U-turning was not allowed, but did so anyway because I trusted his experience. I got shouted at after that because U-turning wasn't allowed and he said he asked me to turn right.

Thank you to everyone who sent kind and thoughtful messages when I first posted. Much love <3\n\nHi all,\n\nI've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.\n\nI returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.\n\nOctober 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my rite of passage from an \"Ah Boy\" to a \"Man\". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly the worst cough and thought to myself;\n\n\"You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior\"\n\nDespite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.\n\nAs weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough (it had started getting better by itself prior to that so didn\u2019t see the urgency). I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91.

As several have pointed out, it\u2019s impossible to ensure a 100% safety rate when there\u2019s always a chance for human error.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Looking at the comments and stories posted by fellow Singaporean Sons about NS, these are the few consistent points being brought up:](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/zDenony)(Click link to read all the stories)\n\n* Chao-keng culture - where people who are legitimately sick refuse to seek medical attention for fear of reprisals, either from platoon mates or from higher ups\n* \u00b7 Culture of enduring\/suck-it-up \u2013 where people just endure through obvious injuries by self-medicating in order not to look weak\n* \u00b7 Culture of targeting people around the individual instead of him \u2013 Where higher ups threaten to extend punishments to the whole platoon because of the actions of a single person falling out\/","481":"","483":"**Posting for someone else with no karma**\n\nSpent 10 days in IMH.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/courts-crime\/river-valley-high-school-student-16-charged-with-murder-of-schoolmate-13\n\n>\"Your Honour, the preliminary investigations revealed that the 16-year-old teenager was previously seen as a patient at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH),\" he said.\n\n>\"In 2019, the police attended to an incident of attempted suicide involving the then 14-year-old.

However, the original Boller\u00e9 BlueCar isn\u2019t a car that I would happily choose to be driving, it was out of mere necessity and convenience. Let\u2019s get into that before we talk about the latest Opel offering. \n\nThe BlueCar is quintessentially French in a way that it\u2019s *in a horrid French accent* \u201clet\u2019s design a car that is too big to be small, too small to be big. And oh we should uh, put the speedo in the middle and have the dashboard be the width of the English Channel where if you put your phone anywhere near it, it would disappear into a inch wide gap much further than your arms can reach. Also for some reason, the gearstick is the other way around to confuse everyone. And 50hp is tres bien, also also we need the throttle pedal to feel like brake pedal and the brake pedal to feel like the throttle pedal. \n\nOdd, exceedingly French design a little better than the Fiat Multipla aside, everything about it screamed \u201clook at moi, I am no more zhan 500 euro\u201d down to the extremely bad stereo and stitching (or the lack of). It\u2019s the first car I\u2019ve ever felt that it was a box on wheels that would only be required to ferry me from point a to point b with a high to very high chance of dying before I reach my destination. \n\nNow to my first drive of the Opel\/Vauxhall\/Peugeot Corsa-E\/208 whatever you wanna call it. I jumped on the old BlueCar to drive about 10 minutes to the nearest Opel that was somewhere in the middle of Pasir Ris with a sense of anticipation to drive the new car, where the driving experience of the older offering definitely amplified. \n\nI did the ol\u2019 rent and tap, hopped onto the tiny 4 door hatchback just to be greeted with \u201ckeys not detected\u201d as I fumbled about in","485":"Before I begin, I would like to clarify that I am in no way paid\/sponsored\/requested by ofo to do this review. I am a regular Redditor just like you and wanted to put this up for the benefit of other shared bike users.\n\nStory time: \nI was walking home when I spotted [this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/krswDtV.jpg) (which I will refer to as ofo 2.0 throughout this post for simplicity) parked outside a shelter. I saw it a few days back on r\/singapore and has been yearning to ride it since. With some free time and the $1.50 60 days coupon which I bought a few days back, I decided to give it a try.\n\n\nReview:\nThe first thing about ofo 2.0 that shocked me is how adjustable the [seatpost](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PHWMbIb.jpg) is. I've tried almost all the bikes from Mobike and oBike and the thing that disappoints me every time is the seat, which are either stuck or the full length of extension is still too short for me (am 1.76m). With ofo 2.0, I extended it fully to the 185 mark and is very comfortable as I am able to fully extend my legs for my downward pedal stroke. +1 to ofo 2.0 for the tallest seatpost in any shared bike right now.\n\nThe next thing I notice as I pushed off is the [basket](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xxy9AmW.jpg). I mean, look at that depth. This can easily fit your Cai Png dabao and you now don't have to worry about your meal dropping out of the basket while you cycle. It can also easily fit a medium-sized backpack for students or working adults. Another +1 to ofo 2.0 for the most spacious basket mounted on any shared bike right now.\n\nWhat surprised me next is how light this bike feels. There is a pretty steep slope near my block which so far I only scaled with my own MTB which has adjustable gears. Usually I would push a shared bike up the slope. However, I felt confident today and decided to pedal up the slope. Holy molly, I actually cleared the climb while seated on the bike seat. Then again, this is probably due to seatpost being extended so I could exert my full streng","486":"I just passed my driving test after have to do 2 retest. Man it was absolutely mortifying to have to see the same instructors. Even during the warm up, the instructor was like \u2018you dont want to pass today?\u2019. However, the tester was really nice. He made small talk with me, made me feel comfortable. So here are some tips:\n\n- ALWAYS LOOK BACK WHEN PARKING LOOK BACK\n\n- For reverse (no pole): \n\nFull Lock Right 3.5 blocks (black and white) is at your shoulder\n\n- For reverse with pole: \n\nMust touch the ledge gently. then must go up. dont touch the pole. Once it touches, drop, then full lock right. Remember to make sure you\u2019re in the centre so that the car wont get stuck in the middle (its an IF)\n\n- For vertical parking: \n\ndrive all the way in-front, make sure your shoulder touches the number. Then reverse till back line aligns w the bar (black\/white) in the middle after the corner. Then full lock left. Bring down mirrors to check. (Start Further from curb)\n\n- For Parallel parking:\n\nBring mirror down. Then when the front door lock handle back touches the end of the curb, full lock left. check the left mirror to see the white block until you see a bit of the black. Then straighten reverse till u touch yellow line. Bring mirror down. Then full lock right. Make sure to reverse before driving off. (Start Close to curb)\n\n- When he slaps the board, E Brake.\n\n- Don\u2019t exceed speed limit when driving outside\n\n- STOP AT STOP LINE (how i failed the first time).\n\nMentally, i really had to control my breathing. Remember to breathe into your stomach, not your chest (makes you even more nervous.) For those retaking, just think of the circuits. Dont think of whats next, dont think of the points, dont look at the tester. Dont look at his screen. Just be present. If you can take the test, it means you have all the knowledge and skills you need to pass it. Also dont count your eggs before they hatch. The test isnt over till you turn off the engine.

IMO, the only people who should be given seats are very old, frail elderly (70-80+ with a lot of laorenban or have a full head of gray hair. ), or heavily pregnant women that look like they gonna give birth anytime soon. \n\nI recall being eyeballed by everyone opp me once when I didn\u2019t give up my seat to a 5-7 yo kid standing in front of me, who kept whining to his parent \u201cwhy no seats for me?\u201d The kid and parent had gotten on the train after my stop, and alighted before my stop.

From here: https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/singapore\/gdp-per-capita\n\nTotal paid hours worked per employee per week in 2015 is 45.6. From here: http:\/\/stats.mom.gov.sg\/Pages\/Hours-Worked-Summary-Table.aspx\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. So, the GDP per capita per week is 52600\/52=1011USD$.\nIn a week, an average worker works 45.6hours. Therefore, per hour the average worker is paid 1011\/45.6=22USD$\n\nGranted, I did some rounding adjustments here and there, but this is the general pay. As of now, USD$22 = SGD$29.94. For ease of calculations in future, I will take it as a worker\u2019s average hourly pay in Singapore is SGD$30. There are of course outliers, those who earn a lot less and a lot more, and perhaps I should take the median, but I was interested in getting fast results. Plus, workers who are affected by MRT breakdowns, will affect those higher up, even those who do not use MRT.\n\n\u201cLRT led the growth with an 18.4 per cent increase in ridership to 180,000 a day.

Let\u2019s round it down to 3 million during peak hour to make it easier to calculate for me.\n\nAlso, imagine that someone takes the MRT to work in the morning, then takes the MRT home at night.

This is a 100% subjective opinion that is not meant to diss the gym outright, but to share some of my thoughts on why turnover is increasing and why members may seek greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nI will start my post by saying this. After five years of training at Evolve, 10 hours on average, I have decided to call it quits. I\u2019m not sure if I will be choosing to head to another MT gym or just take a break for a bit and do something else, but I think that I need to shake things up as there are things about the gym that I feel are starting to really limit my enjoyment.

That puts it as the most expensive MT gym in Singapore, with the next higher tier being Pineapple MMA at around $3.5k, and subsequently most gyms will have a yearly package for $2.6k or so.

He asked me if I have a CHAS card and then expressed his surprise when he found out that I have a CHAS card even when I have a decent job. He asked if it's because my parents are retired, I didn't want to tell him more so I just replied \"yea\".\n\nAfter that, he checked my teeth and then told me that I will be charged a certain amount $x for polishing\/scaling. I was very surprised to hear that because that amount is higher than the $50-$110 that I was told. I questioned him nicely about it, \"oh that's not what I was told actually...\".

This is by far the easiest and most understandable way to understand where the virus stands in our community. This method is good on a surface level, but it is highly susceptible to daily changes like public holidays, weekends, or even completely random fluctuations. As a result, I have presented the 7-day rolling average alongside the raw data to even out these variations and extract long term trends from the data. In this way, we don't see anomalies like the 5k case spike last week or the recent Deepavali dip causing drastic shifts. This standard is also being employed by Google, Our World in Data, the New York Times, and many other highly reputable agencies globally.\n\nIn the data above, we see that during our exit wave, cases climbed exponentially from late August to mid September followed by several weeks of linear growth. Then, shortly after increasing the level of lockdown in late September, we saw a small downturn in early October before seeing a \"double peak\" around 2 weeks ago. Finally, we are seeing a steady decline in cases over the past seven days.

For countries\/territories more... similar (thats subjective) to SG, we have Taiwan at 5.1% and Hong Kong at 0.5%. Make what you will with those figures.     \n     \nCycling on footpaths is allowed in SG, but only at 10km\/h.      \nCycling on Park Connector Networks (PCNs), which includes both dedicated bike lanes and shared paths (for both pedestrians and cyclists), is at 25km\/h.     \nThe average speed of a jogger completing 2.4km in 12mins (you can't even get gold if you're 21) is 12km\/h. Something for you to think about.     \nCycling on roads is allowed, contrary to some nutters here who compare cycling on roads to a helicopter landing on an road (which is obviously against the law). \nIf you want to ride on the road however, you must follow road rules (obviously) wear a helmet, etc.  \nCycling on expressways and certain tunnels and viaducts however, is strictly forbidden.

There are a ton of under the table deals at the expense of homeowners, zero regulation and a lot of scams homeowners have to dodge. It should not be this hard for the average Singaporean to renovate a home. Things need to change in this industry.\n\nIDs don't require to go through any courses or get certifications before they become IDs. This is different from for e.g the real estate industry where you have to register with CEA and wear your tag whenever you are on-site. Or the financial industry where a business may need MAS regulation. For IDs, anyone can call themselves one, start a company and the moment there is a disupute, close down \/ run away with the deposit \/ start a new company. There are many such reported cases in the papers.\n\nBut what I want to talk about here is the under the table relationship between IDs and suppliers that many Singaporeans are not aware of. Because homeowners like us will never know the real prices of materials, we will always be vulnerable to shady IDs and contractors. Because of the lack of regulation, there is nothing to stop IDs from overcharging as they please. Or even suppliers overcharging customers (us homeowners) when we try to manage the process directly.\n\nWe may even be thinking we're getting a good deal when we're not. Think of the Tuk Tuk's in BKK that camp outside a tourist spot in a cartel-like manner to jack up prices together or the taxi mafia that prevents Grab drivers from coming in to pick up tourists.

I've come to several key conclusions.\n\n\n\n**Privacy**: The logic of this app is that it does not geo-locate or give away any identifiable information. While I did not develop the app, I do understand the principles behind it. It will drop 'handshake tokens' to other bluetooth enabled devices, within its range of 10 meters, which are encrypted. Now why should we be unafraid of this app?\n\n* A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. \"9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2\" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.\n\n* B. Duration of contact and proximity to other users. Note that it does not track where you visit. Even if you've been going to some less than desirable places, even if the police wanted to catch you out for visiting a red light district, they CANNOT find this information out from this app. You could have met the person who was infected on the bus, plane, train, car, whatever it is, it only reveals connections and not places. This proximity data is similarly encrypted, which all provides the same level of protection as previous mentioned above. If we take the government at their word, and the apple store with their policies and tight protection concerns about their users, we can very safely assume, short of some global conspiracy where Singapore's government is the FBI,CIA,FSB,NSA,Chinese Intelligence, GIGN, and all other intelligence agencies rolled into one, that we cannot have this information be leaked. \n\n* C.

Sg-born Sg citizen. Completed primary school in Sg. \n\nAt age 13, he left Sg for Canada, together with his parents. He did not apply for exit permit when he left.\n\nAt age 16, they received a letter from MINDEF, telling them to apply for pre-enlistee Exit Permit. In order to apply for the permit, they need to show proof that he was attending school in Canada and they needed to pay a bond (S$75,000 or an amount equivalent to 50% of the combined annual gross income of both your parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher). Parents refused to pay the bond because they were worried that he would change his mind, and not return to Sg after his high school studies (If he did not return to serve NS, they would lose the deposit). \n\nAt age 18, my friend decided that he wanted to return to Sg. When he wrote to MINDEF to explain his circumstance, they replied that he was already deemed an NS defaulter, and he was advised to return to Sg to \"face the music\". He was too afraid of the \"music\", so he did not return. His Sg passport subsequently expired and he needed to have a valid passport for travel, so he applied for Canadian citizenship, which he successfully obtained. \n\nHe went on to complete his undergrad in Canada. After that, he went to the US for employment. To save on taxes, he applied for US citizenship and became a dual US-Canadian citizen (US taxes are lower than Canadian taxes, and dual citizens pay the lower of the two countries' taxes). He is currently working and residing in the US. He also changed his first and last name, and is now holding a valid US passport. \n\nQuestions he has:\n\n1. What are the consequences if he returns to Sg now for a recreational visit? Note that should he choose to return, he shall be using his current, valid US passport, with a different first and last names. Will ICA\/MINDEF be able to find out that he was an NS defaulter?\n2. What if he returns to Sg after age 40?

Note: This post does not discuss whether females should be included in NS. It leans more towards discussing concerns about whether the older gen has an accurate and extensive view of what NS culture really is like.\n\nIn the ST fb post, there were many comments posted by older gen Singaporeans revolving around their admiration for NS\u2019s capacity to nurture their sons into fine, decent men - the classic \u201cah boys to men\u201d view. I acknowledge NS\u2019s abundant potential for character development and I find this view completely valid since I have benefitted from NS. However, I wonder if older gen Singaporean\u2019s views accurately accord to the reality of what NS culture is like, or are they instead incomplete and that they\u2019ve arrived at these views either through their own account of what NS was like for them in the past, or through popular media portrayal of soldiers as sharp, upright and capable men.\n\nMy own parents were personally taken aback when I revealed the prevalence of swearing in NS.

None of my peers and I were surprised by this upon enlisting, since we had expected this. Most of our parents on the other hand, were.

It lives mostly in forested and wooded areas, but has also adapted to many of our parks and other urban green spaces. Some of the places where Red Junglefowl (or birds that look a lot like them - I'll explain in a bit) are easily encountered include Pulau Ubin, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Bukit Batok Nature Park, Fort Canning Park, Pasir Ris Park, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, and Windsor Nature Park. There's a population in the Sin Ming area that was featured in an episode of [Wild City](https:\/\/video.toggle.sg\/en\/series\/wild-city\/ep2\/328761).\n\nThis species is the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken, which is believed to have originated from [multiple domestication events](https:\/\/pdfs.semanticscholar.org\/10ae\/4cd4fb7cfd86dc0e40a991caa63980421e21.pdf) thousands of years ago in various parts of Southeast Asia, southern China, and the northern Indian subcontinent. Both the wild and domestic birds are all considered to be a single species, *Gallus gallus*. So how do you tell the wild Red Junglefowl apart from a [free-ranging domestic chicken](https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/lonesomecrow\/16436354210\/)?\n\nThe first is in coloration - domestic chickens come in all sorts of colours, while Red Junglefowl have a specific look - roosters have bright red skin on the comb (the fleshy skin on the top of the head), face, and wattles (the 2 bits of fleshy skin hanging beneath the bill). They also have a prominent white patch of skin at the ears. The plumage on the neck is golden-yellow, the shoulders are maroon or dark red, and the tail feathers are long and dark green.

My initial reaction was \u201cHmm sounds  sketchy but whatever you do you and I\u2019ll do me\u201d. She claims it\u2019s not MLM and she\u2019s helping people \u201cLive healthier lives\u201d and be \u201cfinancially independent\u201d \n\nOver these two years I\u2019ve seen this MLM shit really take over her life. Her social media posts are filled with ads about their products and recruiting others to join. She even gave up her job and has gotten so many of my cousins, aunts and uncles to join as well. I literally cannot escape, every family gathering they will talk about it, every social media post on my feed will be about them promoting their products.\n\nWhen it all first started she asked me to come join her and I declined, however recently she\u2019s becoming more and more pushy to the point where she told me that if I didn\u2019t sign up she\u2019ll cut ties with me because it shows that I\u2019m not supportive of her. \n\nWe had an argument recently when I told her that her entire MLM company is more like a cult, with her \u201cIf you\u2019re not with me you\u2019re against me\u201d I just find the whole organisation and it\u2019s members to be really cringe. They recently organised a huge gala dinner to celebrate their members \u201cachievements\u201d which to me just looks and sounds like the company pandering to their member\u2019s desire for gratification and recognition.

At the number of cases today its is highly unlikely that contact tracing is possible or even relevant. 2) many people do not report their ART positive status officially undermining contact tracing to be even possible; lets say for discussion sake that only half the people reports their Covid status, that means we have about 40k cases per day. Let say that each of them had contact with 20 people during their contagious phase. This would imply 800k people per day would be subject to \"contract tracing\" or about 14% of the population per day!; and 3) As per the same government rules one just need to sit it out at home when testing positive and can come out after 7 days in any case. **The rules literally imply no contact tracing to be required,** unless you wish to get you result registered, which is likely driven by the asymmetric advantages that you get for travel or to avoid a future booster.: \"If you are ART positive: \ud83c\udfe0 Recover from home. \u27a1\ufe0f No need to see a GP\/polyclinic, if well\/have mild symptoms. \u27a1\ufe0f To register your results with MOH, visit a test centre \"\n\n\\-  \"We need to wait until we no longer need vaccine-differentiated measures\" - 1) what about MRTs, buses, they are not vaccine-differentiated, people just hop on and off.

He did so with some persuasion. 10 minutes later, I realised why he was hesitant. When the train was reaching his stop, he tried to stand up from his seat in the middle of the cabin. He was unable to get up from the seat by himself with no pole to hold onto. He was waving his arms and trying to stop himself from falling as he got up from the seat on just his two legs. The other commuters had to hold him as he was in danger of falling down.\n\n**Incident 2: Elderly man didn't dare to walk to an empty seat**\n\nAnother elderly man was standing in the MRT cabin, surrounded by at least three empty priority seats. I was wondering why he chose to stand, when an auntie started to prod him to sit down in one of the empty priority seats. It turned out that he was afraid of let go of the pole he was holding on to. There was a young man leaning against the partition who was just slightly blocking his path to the empty seat. Just letting go of the pole and navigating that little detour on a moving train was a huge challenge to the elderly man.\n\n**We don't understand the problems of the elderly because we have never been in their position and we look at things from our lenses instead.**\n\nEven I do that.

The 2017 reserved presidency, POFMA, and the calling of elections in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nOn the reserved presidency, it scares me that the Constitution - sacrosanct rules for any country - is something that can seemingly be ridden roughshod over. Widely perceived as a move to preserve power, artificial rules and requirements were suddenly put in place for presidential election candidates. Only one individual was therefore eligible. \n\nOn POFMA, it scares me that the truth is what a small group of people can legitimately dictate it to be. To me, we have facts, which largely determine truths, which in turn determine what the falsehoods are. Facts are mostly set in stone. Did Mr A say \u201cX\u201d? Yes, that\u2019s a fact. By saying \u201cX\u201d, is it true that Mr A is implying \u201cY\u201d, which can objectively and reasonably be inferred from him saying \u201cX\u201d? Maybe, and in some situations both Yes and No can be correct answers. Sometimes, room for interpretation is necessary for what constitutes a truth, and what constitutes a falsehood. In the past weeks we have seen POFMA triggered in relation to politics. It is now clear that what is true or false under POFMA is only subject to one side\u2019s interpretation as it deems fit. \n\nOn calling elections now, it scares me that the PAP can be so opportunistic and power hungry at the expense of the people. The PAP has tirelessly trumpeted the need for a strong mandate so that a PAP government can properly navigate this pandemic. PM Lee says \u201cCOVID-19 is the crisis of a generation. It is more complex and more dangerous than any previous crisis.\u201d Yet, despite the term of Parliament ending only in April 2021, and instead of focusing fully on dealing with COVID-19, Parliament was dissolved last month on the advice of our reserved president. \n\nWhich is why we go to the polls on Friday.

Signed up for BBDC back in the late 2000s, but did not complete my driving lessons. Took more than a decade to restart my lessons.\n2.

When I started on my learning journey, I booked lessons online, and also used the SSDC bot. Progress was extremely slow due to a big gap between my lessons (for example, my first lesson was on 5th September 2022, and my second lesson was on 12 October). The gap is also partly my fault, given that I have urgent meetings to attend and had to cancel last-minute. Tried to camp for slots, but given that I'm working, it's really hard to snipe try-sells.

I started learning in August, right after Circuit Breaker, and got in license in around 2.5 months, in October. If you haven't already read the [guide](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/singapore\/comments\/9tzih4\/guide_on_getting_a_driving_license_in_singapore\/) by \/u\/SteamedChickenRice, you should do that first. It's a good step-by-step introduction to getting your license. I'll just be adding on some questions that I had, and some tips to learning at CDC.\n\n___\n\n\n**Step 0 - Pre-driving decisions**\n\nThere are usually a few things you'll need to decide on before you even start any lessons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**a. Time** - This matters to those with a short time frame, like learning a few months before university. I will say that learning can take anywhere from 1.5 months to over a year. It really depends on how fast you want to rush things, and how fast you can pick things up.\n\nIf you go for lessons every week, a rough [estimate](https:\/\/www.cdc.com.sg\/course\/class-33a) will be 24 practical lessons for Class 3A (auto) and 29 lessons for Class 3 (manual). Divide that by the number of times you are willing to learn each week and you can get a feeling of how long it will take. Usually, private learners are faster due to the fact they can go for the test whenever they want whereas a school will usually make you go through a fixed curriculum. I managed to rush it with 2-3 lessons every week, and taking only 17 practical lessons. Thus, I took only 2.5 months (I could have taken only 2 months if I had planned properly).\n\nAnother thing to consider is when you can actually start. The first thing you will need to do for either private or school is to take the Basic Theory Test (BTT). Go to any of the schools' websites to see their earliest date for BTT. Only CDC will allow you to take a few practical lessons within the circuit even before you have passed your BTT.

These are important metrics, but they are not the only ones that are important.\n\nWith this post, I want to start a discussion around some of the \"hidden\" factors that are not getting as much attention as they deserve. \n\n**Benefits & Side-effects of Vaccines Based on Age and Health Status**\n\nPeople from the same age group are very diverse. A young female with pre-existing conditions and a healthy, active young male have very different risk profiles for both the covid and the vaccine. We know that obese young adults with pre-existing conditions are at higher risk of covid, and young males have a much higher risk of myocarditis from the vaccine, compared to the rest of the population. \n\nWe should consider these variabilities of risks before deciding on blanket policies that treat people within an age group as homogeneous. By stratifying the population into smaller groups, Singapore could potentially maximise the benefits of vaccines while minimizing the side effects. For example, some of the Nordic countries have stopped using Spikevax for males below 30 due to myocarditis risk.\n\n**Mental & Physical Health**\n\nHow are people coping? While I'm sure the safety measures helped many Singaporeans to feel safer, restrictions and overall uncertainty of the situation definitely have negative unintended and secondary side effects that are hard to quantify.\n\n* An unstable economy is usually correlated with depression\n* Work\/study from home could lead to an increase in domestic abuse, poorer diet, and less physical activity\n* Mobility restrictions and pressure to vaccinate could lead to anti-social behaviours\n\nWhile there are attempts by the government to evaluate the mental health of the population, are they comprehensive enough and are they factored into the government's decisions for more restrictions?\n\n**Effectiveness of S","833":"https:\/\/www.caas.gov.sg\/public-passengers\/unmanned-aircraft\n\nThis is obviously referring to the NTU housing manager who flew a drone to check if the rooftop is cleaned.

I think there are a few things we should keep in mind before rushing to blame the government.\n\n* MPs are not infectious disease experts. Realistically, they should not be making decisions based on their own gut feeling or on people's chatter. Instead of prescribing solutions, we should be trying to make sure that they are taking into account advice from experts in epidemiology, such as those in MOH who are probably (hopefully) advising the government on the response.\n* Travel bans do not reduce the eventual number that will be infected; at best, they would simply slow down the amount of time taken to get there.

You will have to submit a scanned photo of your passport, and a passport photo, which both have a file size limit.

Cause the money is stored in the card itself, the card shows its balance when boarding busses\/trains\/slotted into IU for cars.

This is different from Concession cards (the ones with ur IC, name and Face on it), since the authorities have more info to track said card and return the money back.\n\nNew SimplyGo cards are account-based cards, like your Google Drive account. The money is stored on servers with SimplyGo. I believe the data transmission to the card from servers is to strive between allowing you to board public transport and what relevant info to tell you on card reader hence you cannot see the balance (take my words with salt, I\u2019m basing it on experience with TL Staff and observations). Also, you have to not only maintain a balance of minimum $3 (or else you can\u2019t use the card for 2 days lol), top-ups recommends 10 minutes to update the servers (probably thought of as a small issue since you probably have to wait for a bus but still).

Ask you go home spend time with kids\/spouse.\n* If you do work late, he will recognise it one way or another. For example buying bf for you only next day.\n* Has no problems assigning you non-critical projects with long time timeline if he feels it will help you grow professionally or build relationships with certain people.\n* His taichi skills are phenomenal, will literally sweep aside labor intensive and low value trash projects at the HOD and C-level.

I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity & the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people.  Bear with me 1 sec.   Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun & healthy.  Climate, gradient & size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation.  If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you.  Rain just cools you more!  I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry & clean up.\n\nOnly problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful.  Regulations & design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right.  The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs & trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.\n\nToday I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub.  First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail.  Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise).  There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why??

More to be added to this list when I think of stuff. Comments and differing opinions are very, very much welcomed, but please be civil and remember- we're just having a discussion on Reddit, not waging a keyboard war. Full disclosure, I am Malaysian, but in this post, I try to use facts and logic to come to a sound conclusion. If the facts and logic point to an intentional breach of airspace, then I will come to that conclusion. I am NOT a pilot, but I do know a thing or two about aviation, both civilian and military. Any pilot opinions are more than welcomed\n\nFactors supporting the innocence of this incident:\n\n1. **Malaysian AW139 helis do not have RWRs and any intelligence equipment, and thus cannot tell if they are being tracked by a radar or collect substantial intelligence.** If you know anything about military aviation, you would know that not having an RWR when entering hostile territory is the dumbest thing to do. If you do such a dumb thing, you have essentially signed your own death warrant. If this craft was deliberately intruding into SG airspace to test SG's military readiness or to provoke a military response, this aircraft would be under-equipped for that mission- to say the least. On top of that, if it was on a supposed intelligence gathering mission, this heli would again, be severely underequipped. It did not have many sensors that a usual intel aircraft would have.\n2. **This specific AW139 was carrying a VIP.** Don't think they'd intentionally go into hostile territory where they might be shot down by- well- every single air defense system SG has to offer(btw- very interesting SG still uses Igla MANPADS. I'm a big fan of Soviet SAMs)\n3. **TLDR: Navigation errors happen, and have a higher chance of happening in VFR flight.** The long version: The route the heli takes is a common route.

Instead of an easy connection between the two buildings and to the J-Walk that connects to NTFGH and the Devan Nair Institute and IMM, you have to go down, out, and up again.\n\nFrankly, in some cases the single entrance point seems to be chosen to cause the most inconvenience and difficulty - the one furthest away from public transport, the one furthest away from the taxi stand.\n\nI hope I'm not alone.

Some claim that this group of people don\u2019t know what is hard work and have not gone through any form of hardships since everything is given and laid out on a silver platter to them.

They get to go on fully paid exchange overseas, buy designer bags monthly, a brand new BMW for their birthday present etc. One poly classmate of ours have her own chauffeur who will open car doors for her. Another colleague at my workplace casually told us he didn\u2019t opt for BTO as he was gifted a 2.3mil fully paid condo as a wedding gift by his dad.

Do civil servants pay for parking at work premises? In general, yes. If they didn't before, their ministry or the agency they work for is likely to change the rules so they do. \n\nThat's one reason why the Ministry of Education decided to start charging teachers for parking in schools. Most other ministries charge staff for parking, and MOE should do likewise, the Auditor-General's Office said.The decision makes sense when you consider that Singapore maintains a \"clean wage\" system for public servants - a wage system with no or minimal hidden perks or benefits in kind. But the decision drew much public attention and flak - from people who felt that making teachers pay for parking somehow devalued their contributions to society. That debate continues to roil online, but the Government is holding fast to its stand that a clean wage policy means civil servants pay for parking at their workplaces. So that\u2019s clear for civil servants. \n\n**PARKING FOR MPS**\n\nOnline, there was also much chatter and questions about MPs. Is it true that they get to park for free at Parliament House? Intrigued, I asked the Clerk of Parliament. Answer: Yes. MPs - elected MPs as well as Non-Constituency and Nominated\nMPs - get to park at the restricted staff carpark at Parliament House, which is not open to the public, but only for staff and authorised visitors and persons. Staff pay $139.10 for a monthly season parldng ticket Like other civil servants, they pay for parking at their work premises. In contrast, MPs park for free. The rationale is this: \"Members of Parliament (MPs) do not have offices in Parliament House and do not require full-time parking here. As authorised persons to Parliament House on sitting days or when they are here for meetings to perform their official duties, MPs park their vehicles at the restricted carpa","1127":"","1135":"**Edit:** \n* 3\/7\/2022: Not too sure what happened, but apparently my third post in the series did not fit the guidelines in r\/SG.

I first posted on [r\/singapore](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/singapore) about [my visit to Truelove.is](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/singapore\/comments\/bqbu8r\/i_am_a_gay_exchristian_and_i_attended_a\/), where I found that they are centred on a mindset that refuses to engage with criticism. Instead, they ridicule, discount and demean their critics. I have been following their recent Instagram \"fake news\" scuffle, and I noticed that [someone else has already posted about this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/singapore\/comments\/ch80jx\/instagram_account_trueloveissg_is_promoting\/). I feel like it's timely for me to chime in by linking my own experience of the group to my thoughts on their current stand against criticism!\n\n**TLDR**\n\n1. They misuse POFMA language, because POFMA doesn't cover criticism, parody or satire\n2. They refuse to engage sincerely with criticism because to do so entails considering the possibility that they are wrong\n3. Yes, they advocate conversion therapy!\n\nBefore moving on to the article itself, I just want to appeal to you to share [my Medium post](https:\/\/medium.com\/@whatistruelove\/truelove-is-has-proven-that-it-cannot-listen-beb16200d3c0) on your social media.

Amongst other things, I found that Truelove.is operates on an ideology that refuses to engage productively with criticism, choosing instead to interpret rebuttals as attacks on their identity and not their ideology. To recap,\n\n>*Truelove.is\u2019s wilful aversion of engaging with criticism is a return to an \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d strategy that discounts the critic as someone worth en","1147":"","1151":"The question is posted cause I wanted to have a general sense of workplace situation in Singapore now.

My goal is to live in different countries\/cities around the world. Getting a BTO would be a terrible fit for me, so I don't feel FOMO about it. I have a few friends who would be potentially interested in living overseas, but are tied down by a mortgage and say they can't afford to pay both a mortgage and rent.

I certainly don't think I'm \"old\" - statistically, we probably have about 5 decades until we pass away, more than half of our remaining lifespan. Maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle will be a huge contributor to how youthful you feel.

There are people in their 70s doing mountain climbing in Japan who can easily zoom pass all the younger people.\n* I've friends who are married, some with kids, telling me that they envy how I can just decide on a whim to travel or move overseas, which are both things I've done. It's much easier to live this sort of lifestyle as a single person.\n* Being unmarried means you don't have to deal with in-law problems and taking care of 2 sets of aging parents.

People with low GPAs therefore filtered themselves out from mentioning their GPAs in conversation, and what was left statistically was a selection biased pool of numbers that were extremely unrepresentative of the actual population.\n\nIn Singapore, I think a lot of us are raised to recognise these numbers - your GPA, your salary, etc - as signifiers of our moral worth and value to society, an indication of how much you matter. And when this number becomes so entwined with your sense of self-worth, its unsurprising that conversations on reddit (or elsewhere) that discuss these things tend to self-filter for only numbers that people are comfortable with or would even enable somebody to humblebrag a little.

For university graduates, the median salary is actually higher at 7,351. (2021) Not starting salaries but just all graduates.\n\n4. Psychologically-speaking, the \u201cdisbelief\u201d some have is partly due to the difficulty in coming to terms that one might be below the median. It\u2019s quite natural.

Yes, there are bull-shitters everywhere but I can assure you those making between 10k to 20k are sacrificing some things to be compensated that much.\n\nEven businessmen I personally know who get deals from networking and drinking sessions end up sacrificing money and familial bliss for money.\n\nSo if you don't make so much now, ask yourself every now and then what you really want in life. I know families who have 7 people living in a HDB flat with a combined income of $4k a month always happy; conversely I know a guy whose house has a multi-storey carpark and an indoor heated swimming pool who is miserable because his wife cheats on  him and his children are estranged from him.\n\nMy honest take is to always aim for more, but be content with whatever the outcome is.\n\nAll the best to OP and everyone who reads this.","I also wonder when pple talk about salary, whether they are counting take-home or gross, and whether things like employer CPF are factored in.\n\nI mean, your gross might be 4.2k, but your take-home will be 3k+, but with employer CPF would be close to 5k. The feels are quite different.","$6k being too low is true in the context of someone who is thinking of moving to SG for work. In countries where renting is common, the general rule of thumb is that rent should not exceed 1\/3 of your pre-tax salary.

It was planned as separate lines like Bishan LRT, Marina Line. Most of the alignment was like LRT lines. The Circle Line was thought out as an LRT line, BTW. This is a reason for it to be a 3 car instead of the 6 car formation seen in previous lines.\n\nThen you also have the Downtown Line, which also has to be a 3 car since you also have interchange with CCL at Bayfront.

There is so much more development coming along the NEL corridor, particularly in Punggol, Hougang and Bidadari. Adding a mere 6 trains, removing seats or adding 1 to 2 carriages per train isn't going to increase capacity significantly. Just double the capacity and future proof the NEL for years to come\n\nCCL is kinda hopeless at this point, a relic of austerity of years past. Maybe LTA can encourage short distance trips to switch to bus instead e.g. between Bishan and Serangoon, Buona Vista and Kent Ridge","I'm someone who takes DTL once in a while and TEL on rare occasion.

It ain\u2019t about adding length to the mainline. Space wise at depot? Hard to cater. It only can expand towards Buangkok. You need more than just stabling tracks to cater for longer trains. But currently, the depot itself has already been receiving complaints about loud noise coming from train horns. So it\u2019s gonna be a bit constrain.\n\nJust introduce normal & direct route services for peak hours and stop complicate the requirements for passengers to earn incentives. Same fare but seats guaranteed although longer, may be attractive. Likewise, bus priority lanes are needed along these routes. Improvements can be done if LTA stop being rigid & maximise profit driven.\n\nOtherwise, bring back the rationalised routes to the NE region to help elevate the load.

The solution isn't to build more BTOs, or increase frequency of trains, or widen the roads, or build more hospitals (or increase hospital beds), or build more shopping malls to cater to the increasing crowds.\n\nThe only way is to reduce the population of humans.

If I\u2019m not wrong Ma on Shan line portion of the tuen ma line is provision for 8 car train even though at the start it operates with 4 cars. Also those portion that need to be extended are open air thus reducing the construction cost. Also is the station capable of handing the extended train or lengthening the station is needed? Those platform overrun might look like platform overrun but in real life there might be thing hiding behind it which I believe is the ventilation shaft (this one I also don\u2019t know need to ask transportation expert on this) Also I don\u2019t think they will pass fire standard too (this one idk need scdf to advice) Unless you want to start digging to increase length of station a bit unfeasible. There will be a lot of changes needed, a new extended depot for NEL at Sengkang which is open air so should not be that difficult. But Circle line Depot at Kim Chuan which is underground would be a very big problem. \n\n2nd. By doing selectively opening for door, this would be suicidal for the efficiently. How would people get out of the train car without having a lot of time wastage? One of the biggest problem in most transit is the time wastage for passenger exiting the train. That\u2019s why Thomson line have increase the number of doors per train from 8 to 10.  The reason is if you have the train selectively open door during peak hour the train will be wasting time at station for a long time as people need to squeeze their way out.\n\n3rd)With all these headache and problem, what is the final bill of this large upgrading? Does it makes sense to do these upgrade or just build the Seletar line, also a question that needs to be answered by the government.

As a government scholar with a rather high scholarship I can say for a fact that we are predisposed to succeed. Greater exposure to superiors, opportunities and experience GREATLY increase your chance of success. You become more noticeable and more proficient in your job scope simply because of the exposure given. It is truly an unfair advantage that is given to us. \n\n2. The culture of yes men are not reall seen from my perspective, hierarchy is strictly adhered to despite scholarship level and not everyone is trying to angkat bola. \n\n3. I have met many other scholars from the organisation and they are all pretty proud and hold their heads up high. However, my sensing is that it is not built solely from being a scholar. The cornerstone to this attitude would be from the very start of education. If you come from a privileged household and a top tier school, 9\/10 fellas come out being pretty arrogant. Attaining a scholarship merely boosts their ego. There are very few of us that come from more difficult backgrounds. The majority are a carbon copy from hwach or RI (No offence)\n\n4. Scholars are no way the best of our batch. They may be the best academically but fall short in many other aspects. From my experience many are bookworms and hardworkers but do not excel as much in social interactions and enjoying life in general. Unfortunately Singapore acknowledges academics as THE MOST important aspect to attaining a scholarship and due to this criteria, the kind of scholars we see are produced. \n\n5. That being said there are many excellent scholars out there that are absolutely amazing at what they do  and excel in what ever is thrown to them. \n\n6. Singapore's system of choosing scholars is no where near perfect, but with imperfect information of 17-19 year olds, its the best we can do.","instead of knocking SG govt scholarship, is there any concrete system that successfully and consistently creates, and identifies 'leaders' in the world?\n\n'Consistently' is the key word.

It may incur additional travelling time, and will often caused inconvenience at times. Making a trip on 911 to Av2 and transfer to 169\/903, may ended up time saving of 0 or -5mins(extra time). The waiting time may not be in favour if there\u2019s limited service. Wet weather, the bus stop bay May not be sufficient to even fit 2x 12m buses safely. \n\n2) While demands for dual loop travel may not be always high, I think having feeder\/intratown may cut down the queue for parking space inside the interchange itself. Supplementing buses often park aside and not utilise the parking space reserved for full day buses. \n\n3) Reliability may not always be bad for these service. For instance, sv911\/913 still manage well despite having minor delay at times. During Peak hours, additional trips are done by 911T\/913T to reduce overcrowding. This also means bunching frequently occur(2-3 buses at a go), but without compromising the intervals for the subsequent buses. They usually run on their own schedules\/headway. Last time, these service are considered \u201cexpress\u201d as they will skip stops whenever the main service is at the stop. Crowd at last few stops can have a better chance to board the bus also.\n\n4) Longer distance dual loop service can consider 912\u2019s approach, if necessary. But that may cost additional parking lots\/resources.\n\nFor Woodlands, apart from the poor 912 reliability which has improved since 912\/A\/B, I think 911\/913 should not follow the way 912 operates. \n\nAn improvement to any feeder\/dual loop feeder would be to have flexibility in running supplementary buses to adhere to good headways. For instance, they can deploy 903M\/911T during checkpoint jams to ensure that there won\u2019t be long waiting time for the rest of the residences along the route. SMRT done a few times by operating 903M out of the original schedule, which I think it\u2019s worth noting in effort to provide good s","Speaking solely for Yishun, it's high time to review the current feeder services and decide if they should get a total revamp.\n\nOver the past 10 years, not only have the interchange been moved, but there have been the addition of 2 new neighbourhood centres\/malls (Junction 9\/Wisteria Mall), an new hawker centre and (by my estimate) about 20,000 new dwelling units mostly along Ring Road and Ave 6 whose connectivity remains poor.","Bus 317 to serangoon gardens is dual loop by necessity.

I own a motorcycle which I ride when I travel alone and don\u2019t require a car to load items. People think we motorcyclists are dangerous when e-bikes are more dangerous for both the rider and other road users.

E-bikes riders don\u2019t. Many times I observe them running through traffic junctions which even a motorcyclist would normally stop at.\n\nInsurance - Motorcyclists are required to buy 3rd party insurance to compensate damages they cause in case of accident. E-bikes don\u2019t.\n\nSpeed - E-bikes can reach speeds that can cause serious or even fatal injuries, it is observed from hospital research that e-bike accidents are more similar to motorcycle accidents than pedal bicycle ones.\n\nGear - Most sensible motorcyclists wear proper gear like gloves, padded jacket, crash tested helmets etc. while e-bike riders in T-shirts, berms and slippers.\n\nVehicle - Motorcycles are equipped with full suite of safety features nowadays like lights, signal lights, anti brake lock system etc. while the light weight e-bikes barely has anything.\n\nI think e-bikes need to be properly looked at as they are both a menace for pedestrian and road users. If they wish to save money on their own protection gears, at least make them buy 3rd party insurance or even go for road safety course before allowing them to ride.

You see, putting *everyone* on transit and limiting other travel mode options is a bad idea. Your travel is at the mercy of the operators. At first is 5mins, then 15, then 1hr. So, gradually you have to wake up earlier, get home later and spend more time waiting in traffic. \n\nIn comparison, cities that offer many modes of travel have better efficiency of the transit and road systems. The load is spread out across road users, transit users, cyclists, walking etc. More importantly, it forces transit operators to maintain reliability. For example, if the train breaks down too often, commuters will switch to driving or taxis. Yes, overall, the cost of transit will be higher, but on average, across different modes of travel, the cost is lower. So now it becomes which mode (car, cycling, bus etc.) will be more efficient for the commuter, instead of maximizing the number of transit ridership.\n\nSo there you have it. You cannot choose anymore (in reality, the choice is an illusion), and you being on time is now up to SBS\/SMRT. Do you want to wake up early every day in *anticipation* of a train delay? or have to plan ahead everytime you take the train? ","Abolishing COE would drastically increase the number of cars on the roads, creating massive jams. Occasional 30min train delay vs 1h car commute, tough choice...\n\n\nPeople always mention to compare MRT with NY, Tokyo, London or Paris public transportation, but you should actually check out those  cities for what happens when you have no cap on number of cars.","Something something ungrateful people nowadays... something something compare with other countries... something something not happy migrate la...\n\n\/s\n\nBut in all seriousness, I love Hong Kong's MTR and bus system. Its so extensive and easy to navigate. Never have I felt a need to take taxi or Uber there. SMRT on the other hand, being stuck at Raffles Place for almost 10 mins yesterday, awkwardly facing another guy that we were almost kissing, I was frantically checking Uber\/Grab. Sorry if I caused the fares to jump :(","If you think standing for 45mins in a jam is bad imagine atleast 1.5 hours maybe 3? In a traffic jam.. \n\nWhen COE spiked to an all time high of 98K there was still demand, it seems like we have yet to price out Singaporeans, average Singaporeans even. Now just think about what happens when every family gets a car. It won't just stop at one though, with all that pent up frustration of not having a car, you'd likely get a car buying frenzy where every legal driver in a family gets a car. I suppose then we can all just be in our cars saying HAH fuck those peasants that take public transport, I'm way happier in my car :D\n\nI get it that you're just ranting but all I think of is the horrific daily KL jams when I think of a Singapore without Coe. Your car would be utterly useless and inconvenient. ","[deleted]"],"144":["Haha, you'd be surprised. Allow me to illustrate.\n\nEven the new trains were built by Alstom (for NECCL) and Bombardier (for DTL) in China, by other factories, Shanghai Alstom Transport and CRRC Changchun respectively. The last time we had a train *not* built in China was the original C830s, shipped all the way from France. That drove up costs.\n\nNow, CRRC, or China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, is a giant conglomerate able to abuse the heck out of economies of scale, with about 15-20 facilities across China. Each facility is free to choose who to partner with, so long as profit goes back up the food chain. In the former case, Kawasaki partnered with Qingdao Sifang, and Bombardier with CRRC Changchun, and both companies through these partnerships will always be able to build cheaper than the competition. (like for example Shanghai Alstom which is outside the CRRC umbrella)\n\nFurthermore, at the risk of getting sued, I daresay that LTA and Kawasaki are pretty much in bed together. The only reason why we even use Alstom on NECCL was because back then Kawasaki, a Japanese manufacturer, didn't have the experience with automated trains that Alstom had, and Alstom could hence offer a complete solution while Kawasaki could not. Our NEL is just a supersize version of Line 14 in Paris. And the CCL is largely similar.\n\nEDIT to clarify: Contracts are not evaluated purely on cost, as I elaborated in [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/singapore\/comments\/6xze4c\/so_the_submission_of_bids_for_the_cr151_has_just\/dmjlaxs\/). \"Pre-existing relationships\" often help in the technical tender evaluation, especially for fleet additions\/replacements.\n\nThe problem here is that Kawasaki's factory in Kobe is fully tied up because every suburban railway in Tokyo wants to replace trains by 2020 because of the Tokyo Olympics. Thus, other Japanese manufacturers like J-TREC (formerly Tokyu Car), Hitachi, and Nippon Sharyo, are also fully occupied. Hence, Kawasaki has no choice but to build in","In my view, the handling of bids and tenders should be accountable and well-audited. There is the need to understand that tenders and contracts awarding should be undertaken and reviewed by experts. There is next to zero value in getting the laymen involved.\n\nWhat you are trying to do here (to directly ask for the support for a particular bidder) amounts to an attempt to influence such official processes through social media.  \n\nI am not opposed to applying a greater amount of scrutiny to such processes, but at the same time, we need to understand that such efforts should be strictly separated from the favouring of any single bidder which is participating in any bids.

Some quick background:  have traveled all over Asia for work, lived in Tokyo in 2009-20, lived in Singapore first time 2018-19, got trapped back in US during Covid, back in Singapore since Jan 2021.  I am originally from NYC.  \n\n\nI don't necessarily have advice for you on how to handle your Xi-worshipping family.  I'm fortunate that my own family in the US hates Trump and everything he represents, so I don't personally have to deal with such an issue.  But your family's view got me thinking about how as a Western expat in Singapore I currently see the overall situation.  I'll begin by saying that to me it is quite noticeable how much Singapore has drifted culturally toward China in recent years.  Of course it is much different from my first trips to SG in the early 2000s, but even going back to my first extended stay here starting in 2018, it feels more Sino now than it did - for example, hearing a lot more Mandarin than I ever did before, a lot more Chinese media, just a lot more overt Chinese influence.  I recall that back in 2018 there was an article in the Straits Times about China deliberately trying to convince Singapore it was part of the 'Chinese diaspora', no doubt with an eye toward influencing future political behavior.  At the time I unofficially spot-polled colleagues, taxi drivers, Grab drivers, etc. to get a feel for how much people agreed with identifying as Chinese, and I would say at the time it was roughly 2\/3 \"I am Singaporean\" vs. \"I identify as ethnically Chinese.\"  (I should note for the record that I don't actually have an \\*opinion\\* about whether Singapore should be more Chinese or not, as I am just a guest here and so I believe that is entirely up to the home country and its citizens.  So from that standpoint it doesn't bother me, and it is just a facet of living here.)  \n\n\nAside from that context, I see several trends at work here:\n\n1.

It's not easy, especially when it involves very emotional subjects like race and identity. What OP is experiencing has been an increasing occurrence in Singaporean families for some time now, given the increasing number of mixed-national marriages with PRC spouses. The government is not blind to this. During the 2021 National Day Rally, PM Lee explicitly warned in his *Chinese* address that Singaporeans must be aware of the threat of influence from a specific country. No name-drop, but we all know which country lah. Mind you, this was left out in the English and Malay addresses. \n\nImo, the *modus operandi* of the CCP is simple: they don't just want to force you to think and behave like them. They want you to *voluntarily* think like them, hold the same beliefs and values willingly. OP, your father is a textbook example of CCP influence operations success, and god-knows how many more have been influenced in Singapore. Unfortunately, this problem is compounded by the sensitive issue of Chinese culture, language and education in Singapore. A lot of older Singaporeans, like OP's dad's generation, lived through a period of time when Chinese education and culture was sidelined in nation-building efforts. Closure of Nantah and Chinese schools, stamping out dialect use etc. Furthermore, older Chinese Singaporeans are more well-versed in their Chinese history, understanding how China suffered terribly in the past (Opium Wars, Eight-Nation Alliance, European hypercolonisation, Japanese occupation etc.) and has now emerged as a global superpower. I may be stretching logic here, but it is my belief that Chinese Singaporeans are very susceptible to PRC influence operations, more so than other Chinese overseas diaspora because it is seen as an outlet to reassert their identity, in a way riding on China's success to \"reclaim lost honour\".

(I have my doubts about CRL, but that's another story.)","I assume you're suggesting a 2nd round of the [Transitlink Network Integration Exercise between 1991 & 1993](https:\/\/eresources.nlb.gov.sg\/newspapers\/digitised\/article\/straitstimes19901220-1.2.4), which was specifically designed to integrate bus services and improve 1st and last mile connections with the newly opened NSEWL stations at the time.\n\nTo not bore non-bus enthusiasts with too much specific details, as many as 82 bus services were rationalised, and up to 19 new bus services were launched during the Transitlink Integration Exercise.\n\nWhile it is true that the Transitlink Integration Exercise axed many long distance bus routes, it also reinvented numerous long distance bus routes into semi-express routes, such as 30 (by diverting it from Shenton Way to ECP) & 190 (by diverting it from Bt Timah to PIE), which propelled them to their level of popularity today. I believe such reinvention of long distance routes can be explored by LTA as an alternative method to optimise resources, rather than straight up scrapping them.\n\nI can't disagree with you about the peak hour Express & City Direct services, as their demand is indeed not very desirable. LTA should indeed review the viability of some of these services.\n\n51 was actually not a very long route (Eunos - Labrador) back in the 1980s, but SBS thought it'd be a good idea to integrate it with 54 (Hougang - Eunos) & 192 (Jurong - Sth Canal), leading to its current length. I specifically think that 51's integration with 192 was a mistake, and 51 would've been better off terminating at HarbourFront (like 93). 61 & 961 (re-numbered from the former 181) are indeed legacy long distance routes, so TL could've modifed them to more reasonable lengths earlier on in the 1990s.\n\n960 was actually introduced as an integration of the former 182 (W'lands - Shenton Way) & 952 (W'lands - Marina Ctr). Both 182 & 952 were scrapped by TL after the opening of the W'lands extension in Mar 1996, but was brought back in the form of 960 abou",">It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system.\n\nThey also need to consider why many commuters prefer buses to to the MRT. \n\nDecreasing the number of seats on trains to deal with crowdedness makes the MRT less attractive. Sitting makes a ride (especially a long one) far more comfortable and is essential for certain commuters. It is far easier to get a seat on a bus, while seating on the MRT is a source of disputes (NSFs should know what I mean). \n\nMany Tampines residents would rather take a train to Pasir Ris and back, spending an extra 10 minutes to get a seat.","Public transport in of itself is not meant to be profitable, monetising the connectivity arising from the concentration of footfall around these transportation nodes is much more sustainable.

More interchange stations means more journeys can be done faster with fewer transfers, and it also increases system resiliency, so that when one line is knocked out, alternatives exist.\n\nAs for the bus network, as a counterpoint to your thought of shortening bus routes, I think having a mesh of Express busses might actually help alleviate the load on the MRT trunk lines. If you had the choice of a two-transfer crowded rush hour commute on the MRT, or were able to swap that out for a single seat, slightly slower bus journey, you might see people choosing that. Of course, the point about inconsistent travel times remains for the buses, but wouldn't it be nice if there was an express bus network that allowed straight line travel between almost any pair of Bus Interchanges?","When transport ministers talk about sustainability, all they can think of is increasing fare, not improve the transport system.\n\nThat is the underlying problem.\n\nTo a hammer, every problem is a nail.\n\nIf ministers mindset is that every problem has a monetary solution and can only have such a solution, then we'll never see the light of day of better transport system.\n\nAlso, our dear public transport council is the worst bunch guilty of this.

Yet uncomfortable disclosures in recent weeks have put it on the defensive. \n\nSingaporeans are dismayed at the party that has been in charge for even longer than the city state has been independent. \n\nIn mid-July the transport minister, S. Iswaran, was arrested along with a tycoon, Ong Beng Seng, who brought Formula One racing to Singapore. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (cpib) is looking into the relationship between the two men.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, claims the arrests show that the system is working. After all, the government acted promptly\u2014Mr Lee himself gave approval for the cpib\u2019s investigation. Questions remain, however, not least why Mr Iswaran\u2019s arrest was only announced three days after it had taken place. Many Singaporeans think the explanation of \u201coperational considerations\u201d given by Lawrence Wong, the deputy prime minister and Mr Lee\u2019s successor-in-waiting, is limp.\n\nMuch harder to defend are the circumstances surrounding the departure of Parliament\u2019s speaker, Tan Chuan-Jin, once a pap high-flyer. An innocent outsider might assume that his calling a member of the opposition Workers\u2019 Party, Jamus Lim, a \u201cfucking populist\u201d, caught in Parliament on a hot mic, would be the clear reason for his going (Mr Lim was merely arguing that more should be done to help lower-income groups). Mr Tan later apologised for \u201cunparliamentary\u201d language. Yet, points out Ian Chong of the National University of Singapore, it apparently occurred to few pap leaders to reflect on the flagrant partisanship in a supposedly impartial post.\n\nIn Mr Lee\u2019s book the slur was the lesser sin. Worse, he said, Mr Tan was having an affair with a fellow married mp.

This would push owners of empty units to rent out their property, increasing supply and brining prices down. Personally, I am doubtful over whether this would have any significant impact as I don't think there are enough such units (neither owner-occupied nor tenanted) to actually make a significant impact on the overall rental market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) have SLA to release more residential state properties, like the recent case at Little India:\nhttps:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/housing\/decades-old-municipal-quarters-in-little-india-to-be-used-as-co-living-space\n\n\nThe simplest answer would be to increase supply but a more detailed answer would be increasing supply is useless if there continues to be mismatch between supply and demand. \n\n\nAbout 15,000 HDB flats will complete the mandatory five-year minimum occupation period in 2023. This means they can be rented out. But of those that do get rented out, the vast majority would be with live-in landlords.\n\n\n\nOf the 800+ enquiries I received during the past 2 years, for the 2 HDB bedrooms that I am renting out as a live-in landlord, only 2 were from locals. \n\n\nThough I did try to contact prospective local tenants via their profiles on Facebook rental groups, the website rentinsingapore.com.sg and ohmyhome app, most of them prefer to live without a live-in landlord.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is only so much land to build on in Singapore. If that land is built for housing that is not for HDB BTO, but for more public rental housing, then there would be less land for HDB BTO.

I have never seen their popularity as a result of their music, though their early discography did win over a lot of people. Their core work of late is promoting brands (Dior, CK, YSL, Celine, Chanel et al). Jennie and Jisoo have acting careers; Lisa had a stint on reality competition shows. I like BP but I don\u2019t think music is their main focus; their albums have always been really short and overproduced, they don\u2019t have much of a say in their music as far as I can tell. So yeah I do feel what you\u2019re saying but BP isn\u2019t known for their \u2018passion\u2019 on stage, rather the opposite.","Basically, BP performances are crap and their concerts have been lacklustre for years. They're more glorified IG models than kpop idols. \n\nDancing, choreo, and even just simple effort is lacking. Lisa herself said she was the only member that even bothered to practice before performances. You can see it in the way all 4 members are out of sync, making mistakes, and forgetting dances. Respect to Lisa cause she's the only member that looks like she gives a fuck. \n\nBP has an insane amount of casual fans\/general public, which is why their YouTube views are insane. But they don't have that many passionate stans, which reflects in their average album sales. They have been underperforming for 2-3 years now, they just have too much clout to actually make a difference.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd highly recommend going for the upcoming TWICE concert in September. They are by far the best stage performers, and give 110% in all their concerts. Tons of fan interactions, concerts can last 3 hours +, even longer if they're in the mood to keep the encore going forever. Their performances also really set the gold standard for k-pop, and their vocal line will belt out high notes for the entire 3 hours without breaking a sweat.\n\nTL:DR, BP has been crap for years.

Lisa was the only one I felt \u201cenjoyed\u201d being there. Not that the other girls performed badly but it did feel more perfunctory. I felt really apologetic for the heat and could tell it was affecting them, but I think as a performer you have to bring your best in spite of the weather. \n\nI know Jennie asked the audience to put down the cellphones and interact with them more, so I can\u2019t help but wonder if the audience affected their enthusiasm too. \n\nIn my section only 3 (!!!) people brought light sticks. wonder if most of the tickets went to \u201ccasual\u201d fans who wouldn\u2019t be very enthusiastic. There was a huge empty space in the standing area on the first day - is that normal??? Thought all the tickets were sold out. Normally the most enthusiastic hardcore fanbase would take tickets closest to the stage so I felt like casual lukewarm fans made up most of the audience.\n\nIf any one has been to BP\u2019s other concerts elsewhere (like US), would love to hear how it was like for you there.","If you did your homework you would know how infamous BP is for their lazy, half assed performance (with the exception of Lisa of course) as evidenced on multiple fancams uploaded to YouTube. \n\nEven Lisa said in an interview she wished the rest would pull their weight. Well, good for them I guess since they know they're in demand hence, why work so hard when money keep flying your way despite no effort made?\n\nIt's a shame really. Kpop is such a tough industry and for them to take it so lightly now, I believe they had an easy win hence, they're not able to fully appreciate the success they have so easily earned. It's also feels like an insult to the other kpop groups who are giving their 101% yet not being anywhere close to their level of popularity.\n\nIf Teddy didn't give all his best songs to them, would they be where they are today? They were very lucky to have it so easy. Suspect Jennie's dad has some connections too.\n\nAnyways, can see why they're popular.

Aside from Lisa, the rest are mediocre performers, from stiff dancing to the lack of energy.\n\nSeeing that they started off so well in the earlier days, since they've focused on their brand deals etc, it seems like they've lost passion in performing as a whole but overhyped too much and honestly speaking they're more of influencers than performers and this is the result of it","Black pink is now just 4 high end models who just sing and perform for fun.

I know it doesn\u2019t excuse her seeming lack of enthusiasm since she\u2019s earning millions off it but compared to others who wanted to be an idol from the start vs her who\u2019s pushed into being an idol by the agency (she auditioned to be an actress), I cut her a lil more slack compared to the rest lol. There\u2019s a reason why her solo came last. She wasn\u2019t confident about it. I guess she just continued being an idol since it\u2019s really an easy way to success for her.","I was also considering to go but then I saw [honest reviews on Youtube](https:\/\/youtu.be\/qvv6tNID5YQ) and decided not to go. I think the problem with BP is they got fame and success all too fast. It's easier when 3\/4 of the members are fluent in English and their genre appeals to the mass (YG style). Fans like to give the excuse that they are overworked or tired but let's face it --- they took a 2 years hiatus and do not have as many activities as the average K-pop idol. \n\n\n I thought I may be quite biased because I have been a 2nd gen fan (SNSD\/2NE1\/TVXQ\/Big Bang) --- their performance standards are VERY high. However, a lot of 3rd and 4th Gen K-pop can also do seriously well on stage. (Like le SSerafim,Seventeen, MAMAMOO, BTS, TWICE, NCT, Stray Kids, Gidle...). There's just no excuse for lackluster performance from the current biggest K-pop girl group. Especially with their song genre, it should have been much easier to build stage presence and engage the crowd. \n\n\nOn the other hand, if it's Lisa's solo concert, I will go because that girl gives her \ud83d\udcaf every time. Also, I'm definitely going for TWICE's. Saw so many good stuff from the fancams. Also BTS suga and maybe IVE.","Me: knows nothing about kpop doesn't care either\n\nAlso Me: hmm. Good points.

They gave out free water in the standing Pen non-stop to prevent people from fainting etc.\n\nIt was a great first time but never again.","Your criticisms of Black Pink are pretty consistent with other people\u2019s who have seen them perform live. It\u2019s what happens to groups who were born with a silver spoon and a powerful marketing machine behind them from the start. Success comes easy and so they take it for granted.\n\nA group like BTS, on the other hand, will never let their Army down because their success was never guaranteed, and so they don\u2019t take it for granted. Their fans are insanely loyal because the group\u2019s dedication and consistency are obvious each and every single time.  BTS are as loyal to their fans as their fans are to them. Agust D\u2019s concerts next month are going to be phenomenal.","Relieved that I didn\u2019t get tix for this. Thanks for the review, OP.

Great energy and interactions, especially from RV Wendy who had to liven up the crowd when Joy had to go MIA because she wasn\u2019t feeling well.","If you speak to anyone who has been to plenty of K-idol concerts, they would probably have heard this saying before, \"If you go to Korea, you don't need to go for the rest.\" I think for Blackpink, this rings very true. But it's not for a good reason.\n\nThis is what happens when your group become influencers for two years and are forced to go back to there day jobs. While I will holdback my comments for the 4th gen groups, BP is the one group in 3rd gen where there quality degradation is real.\n\nI was honestly shock with how short there encore was, especially considering that I went for Aespa's Seoul concert and that was already short by kpop standards.","blackpink have been half rate performers for a long time.\n\nthey've obviously lost their 'passion' for performing a long time ago, and I'm constantly bewildered by fans making up a 101 different excuses for them on why they're 'tired' or performing this way.\n\ntheir success has been pretty much guaranteed under YG, and with all the brand deals they've been taking, it's pretty obvious performing is now a part time job.","Definitely agree with you on Lisa. From a lot of fancams I've seen and word of mouth, she's the 1 member who tries the hardest during concert. Big kudos for her, just wished the others would follow her lead more.","Let's be real the only reason black pink is famous is because they are from YG and their aggressive marketing. They barely release any songs compared to groups like Twice. They always gave me the impression that they hate each other haha compared to Twice again. There are so many way more hard working girl groups that release song after song and are not even half as famous as them, it sucks but that reality. Most people who attended the concert are not even there to watch them, they are just there so they can post about it on social media. In my opinion the whole concert is a circle jerk for \"influencers\".","Hi OP, i dont know how much of a fan you are of BP, but with their reputation for their laziness at concerts, i would say one usually have to be a fan to enjoy their concerts. If you arent that much of a fan of them, i guess i hope you had somewhat enjoyed what little pros they brought to you haha. \n\nIf you are the type to attend concerts despite you not being a fan, i would recommend you to attend IU's concert the next time she comes to sg. She really interacts and talks alot during her concerts despite not being super fluent in English, and encores are literally guaranteed and usually lasts quite a while as well (cue the famous 5.5hr concert haha). Add on to that the 100% live intruments and vocals too.","I share OP's observations not because I attended the concert, but it resonates with what I have seen when they first started. Jennie's low energy and frequent complaints from fans of she is being lazy. She by nature I suspect is just low vibe person. Lisa I agree from the very start has been engaging and honest to the trade as a performer.\n\nInitially I thought it was a Korean thing but it was not the case with the other Korean groups.\n\nHere are something that I struggle with over the years;\n\n* despite their years together, there is no attempt to improve their vocals and cover areas where they are weak. I have seen experts providing technical details on voice range and what to address for each of them. No change.\n* Jisoo still cannot carry a single line in English. It does not make sense as her values in branding and fashion would be immense. I am sure the company can engage the best English tutors that money can buy and she can afford it as well. And she is is good actress.\n* Their dance routines has only one person doing it well and that is always Lisa. And they were said to have spent years training in dance and singing before they became an item. The coordination and syncs are not there.\n* Even at Coachella, their routine was lacklustre even though in video clips and interviews they were very enthusiastic about being there. This surprised me.\n* For some reason, Jennie gets the best outfit while others do not. Why not for all. Take Coachella for instance, Lisa's was very bad and she will do much better in many other outfits\n* Lisa's manager siphoning her money for gambling and the company was not aware, They were shamed into covering her losses.\n* Rose is a bit of a free spirit like Lisa but she is humble and attempts to engage the crowd but then stops and I suspect she does not want to take over Jennie. I also noticed that Rose and the others are not given guidance when attending  interviews so her comments don't come across as coherent. Jennie on the the hand ca","It's actually such a coincidence because I was talking about love performances with my friend during dinner last night. As you may know ColdPlay is coming to Malaysia and my friend and I were talking about that.\n\n**Warning: I'm being a hater**\n\nBeing a fresh grad with no money, I was pretty against going to any concert at all, but the important point is when comparing the live concerts of Coldplay and BlackPink on YouTube... Well you tell me what you feel.\n\nAs someone who hasn't been to any concert at all, and probably won't be to one for the next few years, I think anyone who enjoys BlackPink will enjoy Coldplay, but not the other way around. If a gun were put to my head and I was forced to join a Coldplay concert, I don't think I'd regret it.\n\nThis is the first concert I seen from Coldplay. It's probably one of their best, but the other concerts I saw on YouTube were pretty great as well\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Fpn1imb9qZg\n\nI didn't find any particularly good concerts from BlackPink but you're welcome to share.","Went to taeyeon concert and enjoyed every single moment. She gives her all, make funny jokes and chats with the audiences. Lit vocals \ud83d\udc95 had funny VCRs (just abit for her to change clothes since she's alone) and she SANG AND DANCE 20+ songs! Can't wait for her next concert (supposed to have one right before COVID and was cancelled!)","Regarding your critiques on the individual members, I'd have to say that after seeing them live at a few concerts in the US, they're just terrible live performers.\n\nThey aren't strong vocalists so they're lip syncing almost everything and other than Lisa, they're all mediocre dancers. So the end result is an insipid and lacklustre live performance. \n\nI think there's definitely a lack of effort on their part, other than them not having the ability to deliver. Their headlining act at Coachella was probably the most enthusiastic I've seen them, so they can definitely give a decent performance.","I'll just say this. Without Lisa, blackpink wouldn't even still be a group with their lackluster performances. She's the only one who enjoys performing whereas the others prefer to act or be influencers. The only thing keeping blackpink relevant is their costumes and fashion ambassadorship. \n\nI'm just appalled at how they get away with being the most mediocre kpop girl group out there.","ok but you aren't the first to have these thoughts tbh. if you have scrolled through forums\/ kpop subreddits etc. you would've seen very similar complains about their stages since the start of their world tour. BP (with exception of Lisa) seems more into being influencers\/ global brand ambassadors than performers at this point.  not a hater, also a casual fan of BP so yeah.","Veteran kpoper here and here\u2019s my two cents - Objectively BP hasn\u2019t always been bad, they were pretty good up till AIIWYL but that\u2019s about it. They started becoming the staple where YG just wanted to market them as the it-girls and that idol life is their secondary career while modeling and brand ambassadors are priority. The lack of promotions, concerts and all those attribute to the lack of quality performances build-up till date. So I\u2019m not surprise about this and when their concert energy, quality, standard is just not up to expectations. They just lack practice in general imo. And that 1h40min duration, it\u2019s consistent with all stops, their discography is just not extensive enough to hold a concert that\u2019s any longer than that.\n\nI hate how they give kpop concerts a bad name because concerts from Suju are incredible good. More experienced ones I\u2019ve been to like SHINee, NCT Dream, SVT are heaps great. BP is just highly overrated.","Was at the concert too but thought the crowd was honestly disappointing. I guess performers do feed off the energy of the crowd but unfortunately there was just a sea of phones and close to 0 fan chants. Compare this to their concerts and the crowd energy in Thailand or Manila (seen through tiktok) and you can easily tell the difference.","[deleted]","How does it compare to  Jay Chou?","Fully agree with you on this. I love Blackpink too, I've bought every album since the first time I got into them in 2019 and I think another commenter hit the nail on the head. Their appeal is mostly to casual fans, people who don't really have any exposure to other kpop groups and to them, whatever the pinks have been doing on stage and in mvs etc is THE standard. The casual fan helps rack the views and streams up but given that Blackpink is their sole point of reference to kpop they will never compare the choreo, fan service etc to the dozens of other groups that do it better, more sincerely and with way more effort and energy. Having said that, catching a major vibe with those other casual fans made the concert fun for me, a huge blink who went by myself. These casual fans I met in the standing pen sang and danced along to every single song and when I asked if I might see any of them in September for Twice they were like nah I only listen to BP. And its thanks to those casual fans who take these sub par concerts to be what kpop is, that BP continues to thrive. Also, special mention to Lisa, I'm a Rosie stan but by god Lisa is now the best live performer I've ever seen. No drop off in energy, she put 100% into every move and was just generally so fun and energetic to watch, she rescued the concert for me personally.","I have no idea what a Blackpink is, but I have worked backstage at such events, and if you think the artistes are there for any reason other than your money, you're dreaming.\n\nGranted, there may be artistes out there who really treasure their paying fans and which treat them like more than just a dollar sign, but that's the minority of artistes tbh.\n\nClearly from your overly-long rant, this Blue-black group isn't one of them. But as long as their sheep keep throwing money at them, they don't care.","Feel like you're posting this in the wrong sub. Seems like it's better suited for r\/kpopthoughts. The points you raised aren't new. Many people online have complained of the girls phoning it in for some time especially on this tour. Some have suggested that the girls aren't really into the idol life anymore these days, now that they have other more exciting opportunities that they're interested in, like modelling. It's not surprising for interests to change as they get older too. \n\nThere were sightings of [Lisa at Changi Beach ](https:\/\/vt.tiktok.com\/ZSL1cSW4c\/) after the concert on Saturday night. Seems like she met with some relatives.","TWICE FTW!","Eh bp has always been performing like this? Exceptions for Coachella maybe. I went yesterday for their seating and except for the fact it was short I don't have major gripes about it? Theyre just performers lol. I will say though the crowd is pretty boring, i was in seating and only a few people had the light sticks and a lot of them were just seated still for their performance and were mainly filming the whole ass concert lolol. \n\nI can understand people's complaints about standing zone but like it's normal to not be able to see anything unless you're at the barricades.

He refused to add me on fb because he said he doesnt only want to be 'friends' because when you add on fb it will say xxx is now your friend. He showed me his fb from his phone to show its not because he has another gf. He told me he is willing to change his number and only give me and his mum the new number, effectively cutting off all his friends. Said he wants to change his job to suit my schedule, wants to buy a house beside mine etc etc. Yes that time I thought it's sweet bit looking back its creepy as hell.

Which guy told you this????\" \n\nOne guy we arranged to meet and then he kept saying things like can't wait to hug you and hold your hand. I said there's no way we're doing that on the first date. He kept saying until I got creeped out and cancelled the date. He then called me a bunch of names and said I deserve to get cheated on.\n\nAnother one also said something creepy and I rejected meeting him. After some time he apologised (said he realise his mistake after talking to his mum lol) and begged for another chance. I said no. Then he asked for a group date and said he can introduce a good guy to me. I said no again. Then he asked if I'm an introvert and I said yes I am. He said introverts are the most selfish people on earth because they expect extroverts to carry the conversation. Should have blocked him earlier. \n\nAnother one was some guy, normal at first and we exchanged numbers . I shared abit of my problems and he started preaching and told me I was wrong to be an atheist. Then somehow he asked if I would marry him for 20k. Of course I said no.

This other guy I guess I have a long history with. We started talking when he was in NS, but he was incredibly mean to me and eventually I stopped contacting him. Years later he reached out via fb, and after a couple months of talking he apologize over how he treated me. He shared that he was seeking phycological help for his depression and all in all I just thought he had grown. Anyway, the rl was rather on\/off, usually off when he suddenly found himself a girlfriend. The last bit was when he had a girlfriend, and he texted and asked if I was down to hook up and I questioned about his gf. He said the sex isn't great with her and that he reckoned I would be slutty enough to just go along with it.\n\nAnyway I'm certain ny experiences aren't that bad at all.

Incels don't treat girls as individuals, but as one broad, generalised category. If a girl leaves her boyfriend because she has found another guy with earns more, it becomes \"all girls are superficial and money-minded\" or \"all girls are selfish and heartless bitches\". Same goes for girls who say \"all guys think with their d\\*cks\".  Incels see gender first and ignore the person behind the gender. It's no different from racists who see the colour of your skin first and decide what you're like before getting to know you as a person.\n\nSecondly, incels think about getting a girl first and hunting for someone (anyone!) to fill in that category. If someone approaches you with the intention of wanting to get something from you, of course you would avoid that person. You would cut off that friend who bugs you to join his MLM or harasses you to buy his insurance policies right? Because they just see you as a money bag. Even if an incel manages to lure a girl in with \"you're so pretty, you're my dream girl etc etc\", it's a relationship that's never going to last because it wasn't based on anything concrete like shared values.","How can you be an incel here when you can go siam diu with all that money","Just some comments after reading the whole thread.\n\nFor context, I was incel in my youth (before the incel term was even invented) but later wised up, married and now family man with children.\n\nHonestly, finding a girlfriend is not that difficult if you are willing to put in some effort and change mindset a little. \n\nThe hard non-sjw truth about women is that they want to feel secure. Forget all the female empowerment bs. At a very primal, instinctive level, women all want a partner that makes them feel safe. This is why you hear requirements like \"must be xxx cm or taller\" or \"must earn $xxxx and above\". It's not that the lady is shallow \/ materialistic but rather these are some quantifiable factors they use to define security (whether these are accurate indicators is another matter). \n\nSome things that can help would include:\n\nPersonal grooming. Get some nice clothes, nice hair cut, make sure you don't stink, walk with a straight back etc\n\nLearn how to hold a conversation. Read some proper books, watch educational shows, keep up with the news, follow some trends that ladies do, know how to crack jokes...\n\nPortray confidence, drive, initiative. If you feel sad because you are bbfa in a low paying job, find something to boost your self esteem. Go workout, exercise, have a plan to improve the job predicament you are currently in...\n\nSet realistic expectations.

It's more important to find one of good character. Observe how she treats her family, friends, lifestyle choices etc...\n\nAnyway the most important thing for incels is to keep trying.

The real question is why - because they're very tired, and have very little incentive to try harder. Any free second is consumed either by NS, RT, work or upskilling. sg women are too low quality for them to try harder, mail-order brides obviously don't love them, so why even try? Even having a hobby for the sake of fun is tiring. Since they cannot get anywhere, they just relak one corner with their waifu.\n\nsg women are very low quality as far as values for a spouse go, extremely materialistic, princess syndrome, very demanding, white-worshipping, extremely status conscious, completely unable to do basic household duties (at least sg men can do this) and insecure. Again, the real question is why - Singapore is capitalism on steroids, so they naturally feel insecure. They need to feel superior both materially and in terms of status to feel comfortable. Hence their extreme neuroticism, and desire after money and status. You don't hear women of other countries saying \u6ca1\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u611f, its something uniquely Singaporean. A well adjusted woman will feel secure by herself, regardless of how her spouse is.\n\nThe real issue in the end is Singapore is too stressful for locals, so everything becomes dysfunctional. For expats, beyond their massive pay packages, much less is expected from them, and regardless of how stressful it is, some day they can either go home, or migrate to a less stressful countries.

The author argues that public transport should be viewed through a broader lens, focusing on its social and economic benefits rather than just profits.\n\nThe post highlights that the TEL serves lower-density areas, and the key to increasing ridership is to improve service quality. The author suggests that diverting bus routes to support the TEL may not be effective and criticizes the idea of forcing people onto trains. The argument is made that buses can be efficient and reliable if they are given the appropriate priority.\n\nThe author also questions the effectiveness of a hub-and-spoke model for public transport and points out that it may lead to inefficiencies and inconvenience for passengers. The post argues that the focus should be on providing high-quality service to attract more riders, rather than reducing bus services.The post criticizes the use of an example from Ottawa to support the idea of reducing bus services, as Ottawa's approach has not been successful. It also highlights that increasing service quality and reducing traffic congestion can bring substantial economic benefits.\n\nIn summary, the Reddit post criticizes the original message for focusing on profits and suggests that the key to improving public transport in Singapore is to prioritize service quality and efficiency, rather than cutting bus services. It argues that reducing traffic congestion and providing better service can lead to significant economic benefits.  \n\n\nalso wanna point out OP you say the other post is long but yours is 3431 words bro... more than 3x the original","I agree that the original post from OOP was unnecessarily complicated and used some questionable examples to support what seems to me a relatively simple main premise: Singapore should do more to proactively rework its bus network in order to better support ridership on new MRT lines and to maximize the advantage of each mode of transport. \n\nHowever I think that the better approach to critique that article was to suggest better ways of supporting that premise, rather than spend paragraphs after paragraphs knocking down the relatively weak examples used. Of course it can be done, but after that, so what? I don't feel that a better understanding has been conveyed or the conversation has moved forward in any way.","Man, I would kill to be you.

Here\u2019s one thing I disagree with about your post. You\u2019re right that public transport cannot be run like a normal business and is a public service. But that does not imply that we cannot consider things like revenue and profit in order to estimate the size of the social good that had been provided. It\u2019s dishonest to argue that OP is only solely focused on profit when they clearly are focused on efficient allocation of a public good.\n\nAs an analogy, we don\u2019t measure the quality of schools by how much revenue it collects. However, revenues are a good proxy to how many students attend that school. If we built a school that served only 10 students but has 6 storeys and 30 classrooms, then surely we have clearly misallocated the public good.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the framing with profit and revenue, then the same question can be asked without those terms: could these stations and lines have been built elsewhere where ridership would have been greater and served more people?\n\nThe original sin of DTL and TEL lines is that their stations are built in perplexing locations with low density.","This post seems like nothing more than an attack on the OP.

Importantly, the presumption of innocence must be observed unless proven otherwise.\n\nIn the age of social media and communication, an acquittal alone is not adequate to relief the falsely accused of the implications that false allegations bring about. His name will forever be etched on the internet. Aside from mental and financial drain, clientele and friends have been lost, trust eroded. Gossips will still go on even after the verdict. As much as it is unfair, if two candidates are equally competent, companies will tend to gravitate towards one with a clean background rather than one with an acquittal record.\n\nIMO, all names should be redacted unless a conviction is reached. At the very least, this should be accorded to defendants of severe offences, or offences that have the propensity to invite wide outrage. \n\nRegarding the second proposal, some people may find it unjust to grant anonymity to some defendants but not others. However, such misalignments are already in force. Young defendants are automatically granted gag orders, so are women who are on prostitution charges. \n\nI suppose one reason for this is to protect such persons whom are deemed vulnerable, and this measure is to shield them from repercussions that may disproportionately affect them.\n\nBut then take this case in question.

Falsely abusing the justice system and the media for a personal vendetta truly sets everything back.

Equal treatment of all genders, and this means helping to do away with patriarchal norms, toxic masculinity and oppression across all sexes.\n\nI remember one particular documentary on CNA in particular when the OP brings up this issue. It was trying to highlight domestic violence against men. And how society cannot accept men reporting domestic violence across both camps. Females victim-shame the victims and males emasculate the victims without empathy. Victims become pariahs with no refuge. Now this is what we need to fix, with rising equality we cannot simply ignore needs because they don't fit gender norms. How can we have equality when it's coded in our legal system when men can only legally be sexually abused or raped by other men and not women unless they are a minor. These are just a small facet of the bigger issues.\n\nTo be 100% clear, I've been touched inappropriately openly in front of others by female students and gay male students when I was studying in poly without my consent. But as a male, when I told them to stop everyone literally laughed it off and continued harassing me openly in public with no recourse because it's publicly acceptable. This happened constantly over 3 years I was there and it still sends chills down my spine that society today believes it's acceptable behavior.","Until the penal code is amended to include WOMEN as able to rape MEN, this issue will continue to be a gendered issue no matter how you spin this.","[deleted]","Saying false accusations are rare implicitly downplays the severity of actual false allegations and the impact it has. So what if it is rare? Is it not important to have a national discussion about this matter and seek to find ways in which we could bring about a better or more positive outcome?\n\nYou know what? The majority of men don\u2019t commit any sexual violence in their entire lifetime either. It is **rare** to find a random male individual who is actually a sexual offender. But we don\u2019t go around parading this fact and pretend that women who are victims of sexual violence shouldn\u2019t be afraid or worried just because the next male they meet would likely not be a sexual offender in terms of probability.\n\nWe can believe sexual violence survivors without having to downplay the distress caused to men who are wrongly accused of sexual assault. Both are terrible and both deserve a national conversation of their own, at their own time. \n\nWomen are no less the oppressors than man are the oppressors, whether in terms of sexual violence or false allegations.

Based on MHA statistics (https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/singapore\/courts-crime\/about-40-per-cent-of-sexual-assault-cases-from-2017-to-2019-involved-victims - secondary source reporting, YMMV) the total number of sexual assault complaints reported from 2017 to 2019 is 6988, of which 1368 prosecutions were proceeded and 931 convictions obtained. \n\nEven if one takes the most liberal interpretation of these statistics and assume that each of the 6988 cases involve different victims (because, as Min Shan noted, \"the number of victims does not tally with the number of cases, as a case could involve more than one victim, or a victim could be involved in more than one case\"), that means that over the course of 3 years, a total of 6988 women were sexual assault victims (deliberate word choice, even though the more precise word, if we want to be honest about it, would be \"complainant\"). \n\nThe ratio of men to women resident population over 2017 to 2019 has stayed relatively constant at around 49:51 (source: SingStats). Meaning that the women resident population is approximately half of 5.65m - roughly 2.83m. \n\nThe percentage of sexual assault victims over the three years across the resident population is therefore 0.24%. \n\nNow there are, of course, issues with how I reached that number, but the point I want to make is that as small and statistically insignificant 0.24% is, *no one would ever say that sexual assaults are rare and use that to handwave concerns away*. \n\nSo why the continued banging on the drum that false accusations are rare? Is this trying to reframe the issue into a debate over the definition of what is \"rare\"? Is that even a fruitful discussion to begin with? Should the principle be,","Rare doesn\u2019t mean unimportant. To use a current example, mRNA vaccine related anaphylaxis and myo-\/peri-cariditis are exceedingly rare. But do we simply brush them off?\n\nAny reasonable person has little appetite for accepting false accusations as collateral damage because this would have happened in the context of a system (the judiciary) that was explicitly designed to bring justice when wrong has been done. Examples such as these are the epitome of irony, and betray the fundamental reason of why we even have laws, judges and courts. Any harm done to an innocent by the justice system is particularly egregious. People are right to be angry.\n\n\u201cBelieve\u201d is not an objective term. The police owe no duty to believe anyone. Their duty is investigate any complaints without fear or favour. To establish facts and hopefully arrive at the truth.\n\nThere is zero necessity to \u201cbelieve\u201d anyone in doing this.

The reason for this saga is because the doctor was wrongly accused.\n\nThe second point is moot as well because clearly the \"victim\" was taken very seriously, so much so that the judicial process took 4 years. Also, going with the recent sentiments on gender, it seems that the power imbalance between men and women is no more - words are not worth less for women than it is for men.\n\n-------\n\nThe point of contention is \"why did it take 4 years for the doctor to clear his name?\" A common conclusion in this case is that the \"victim\" exploited the power imbalance between men and women. Are men actually disadvantaged in the court of law and court of public opinion?\n\nOr perhaps, the power imbalances in this case is actually not due to gender, but that victims are simply more protected than the accused? If the latter is so, do we need to impose more control on the media to protect the accused?\n\nEither way, it is tone-death to continue advocating feminism in the context of this case, because at best - there is no gender imbalance to rally against - and at worst - feminists should acknowledge that the power imbalance exists and call for justice, and not ignore and change the topic to real survivors.","I strongly disagree with that concept of \"Believe.

It\u2019s incredible that the school still clings on to this format.","[deleted]","With regards to the NTU shuttle buses, I get the impression that the university management as a whole does not treat them with enough importance to run the services in a coherent manner. It appears that the management is happy to let students rely on the SBS Transit buses 179 and 199 plying through the campus, and the internal shuttle is mostly an afterthought.\n\nA key problem I have with the system is that **none** of the routes have a proper terminal to start and end. The closest you all have to a terminal is a haphazardly paved patch of land near the Graduate Halls where the buses park. This \"terminal\" is located not quite along the route but in between bus stops, so buses have to end at Saraca (Blue) or Hall 10 (Red) while starting from Opp Hall 10 (Blue) or the Grad Halls (Red).\n\nHowever, the route doesn't have a formalised start or end, so the bus drivers have to exit the \"carpark\", drive multiple rounds (up to three!) before terminating, to ensure that there is service across that gap. Anyone who understands bus bunching can tell you that having each trip be three rounds long will cause the buses to bunch up and the timings to be terribly irregular. The driver cannot guarantee that each of the three rounds will take the same time to complete! In contrast, at NUS where I'm based, the buses travel one round maximum and layover at a terminal that is along the route. So the departure times at the start of the route are always guaranteed to be regular - if a driver is fast and early, the break ensures he departs the terminal on time instead of too early, while if he is delayed along the way, he can speed up to reach, and subsequently depart, the terminal on time instead of late. Not to mention that if the drivers get more breaks, they'll have an easier life and hopefully drive safer.\n\nThe timings are also not coordinated, and appear to be based on when the drivers need to change shifts to drive for other contracts outside campus, so I've encountered the situation w","As an incoming NTU freshman who's about to start school in a month, honestly this is quite alarming to read. I wish I had researched more about how messed up the school administration is before accepting NTU's offer back then. If I knew about the STARS system and the lack of quality education, I would probably have chosen NUS or SMU over NTU in a heartbeat.","> In 2019, NTU cancelled heartland shuttle buses under the guise of 'low ridership'\n\nDefinitely due to financial difficulty. The crappy on-campus shuttle service is also due to the unwillingness to pay a bit more to the contractors.\n\n> Lack of quality education\n\nThis is the issue of how NTU positions itself. Since university ranking does not look at teaching, it just gets ignored. Faculty members are also under the stress that the university tries to squeeze every bit of 'utility' out of them with an emphasis on research. In my view, this is unnecessary and not a sustainable way to retain the faculty members as it creates a vicious cycle: \n\npeople left -> higher cost to hire people (need to pay higher salary) -> more extraction from the new hires -> new hires left\n\nEdit: added the second part of the comment on education quality","[deleted]","Just to add on, at the start of Covid pandemic, the govt announced that WFH should be default. However, the NTU staff were still working in school. But the workplace has spread across to the tutorial rooms at Arc. Isn't NTU should be adhering to govt's direction with ongoing pandemic??\n\nNot only that! Govt also announced that the event that gathers masses together is banned. But NTU still continues to hold finals onsite with hundreds of students in the examination halls under the same ventilation system, which was the prime suspect of Covid outbreak at TTSH! None of us were vaccinated at that time. All they do was take student's temperature and issue them with the green sticker to \"verify\" that students are well. Wow, we didn't know that the green sticker will stop Covid. What a joke!","Totally agree with this post, wanted to add on my own experience with the school\/hall administration that I don't think many people have talked about recently\n\nSome context:\n\nLast semester it has been pretty commonplace to see a pair of wild long-tailed macaques around the North Hill halls. You may remember other posts such as the [monkey stealing bread from the North Spine bakery](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NTU\/comments\/n7njyx\/monkey_brazenly_stealing_bread_at_north_spine\/), or the other [monkey stealing cup noodles at Crespion halls.](https:\/\/stomp.straitstimes.com\/singapore-seen\/monkey-steals-cup-noodles-in-ntu-then-scales-railing-to-open-it?fbclid=IwAR2MCPku30-HVB5bZRbpg-F1AanRS-2gJhcgjejscNj7w_d0kwE_y39pvHY#xtor=CS1-10)\n\nThroughout last semester, there have been several occasions where these macaques have invaded students' rooms by sliding open the mosquito net and causing havoc inside, digging through plastic bags and ripping packets of food, defecating on the table, etc. (of course I'm complaining because I myself kena)\n\nJust talking to friends who stay in the NH halls area, it has basically become a \"norm\" seeing someone's room get raided or seeing monkeys camping the Cates food delivery drop-off point table.\n\nThere were several occasions where the monkeys would even appear at lift lobbies on upper floors of the halls to dig through the rubbish bins. The issue had escalated to the point where these monkeys were completely unafraid of people (would invade rooms even with people inside, would attempt to open bags at the NH playground even with adults and children there)\n\nUp til now, I still get updates that these monkeys have continued to wander common areas of NH halls.As for what have the school has done about it, they set up the \"long-tailed macaque committee\" to address this issue. Their first few actions were to change regular rubbish bins to monkey-proof bins (basically a bin with a latch that monkeys would not be able to easily open), and to set up signs ","I assume most of us here understand you guy\u2019s issues. I think most of the people that don\u2019t understand are from FB. I\u2019ve seen multiple oldies commenting that students are starwberry, don\u2019t know how to work for their education. But they don\u2019t understand shit luh..","Haven\u2019t seen this being discussed so I wanted to bring up NTU\u2019s lack of support towards the humanities. From the get go, it\u2019s very obvious which fac NTU prioritises. For students who take ureca, we are made to attend workshops that do not benefit our research areas at all (eg our projects are mostly interpretation with little to no data involved yet they force us to attend data cleaning, data sorting workshops in order to pass ureca). I\u2019m not sure if the administration even knows this or just assumes every student has to deal with data in their projects. Even in the template and guidelines they give us, it\u2019s obviously skewed to the sciences. Aim of study, methodology, results and impacts - these are not how a humanities paper is written. Even our profs (loveliest faculty members ever) are aware of this and are resigned to us having to skew our papers to fit ureca\u2019s requirement. Also, it\u2019s a known fact that it\u2019s much harder for humanities fac to get research grants\/tenure, which is honestly a wasted opp because any one of us will tell you that our profs are really passionate and genuinely want the students to do well (which is why I was surprised when I heard about fac from other schools just plonking theory on their slides and reading off of it during lecture). Humanities profs are ones that really care about student wellbeing, they go out of their way to find us opportunities when they hear about our concerns, or if they know that a student needs help say, finding a job etc. I honestly find the lack of support for the humanities disappointing but I guess it\u2019s also the same in other countries where the arts and humanities are seen as non essential and disposable.","NUS student here who did local exchange in NTU. \n\nI was really shocked at how the modules are taught in NTU. I took an EEE machine learning module, but all we got from the prof was a big bunch of messy slides of pure theory, and he would simply read through them during lecture. And the prof uploaded his slides (about 50-100 slides per chapter), in a format where we couldn\u2019t use Ctrl-F function (????). I have no idea why that restriction was there in the first place. I had to email in to request for the slides to be uploaded in a Ctrl-F-able format. The worst part was that the quizzes and final exam were based on memorising content. There was no coding involved in the entire module.\n\nI took an MS module that was based on pure memorisation as well. The worst part was that there were past year papers available in the printing shop. All we had to do was memorise the answer keys because there was a very obvious pattern of repeated questions throughout the years. I learnt nothing from this module. \n\nBack in NUS, all of my exams for my engineering modules at least included a one A4 sized cheatsheet. The exams consisted of application questions instead of definition questions.\n\nI spoke with other people that took these NTU modules with me, and all agreed that they sucked.\n\nApparently this is the norm for engineering students (memorising content for assessments)? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nThis method of teaching feels very traditional and backward.","Don't forget about the Tong Tar bus drivers who were literally watching Chinese drama on their phones while speeding down steep hills on campus.

I was lucky that I usually end up being able to get the index I want anyway by doing quick changes with my friends or through add\/drop, but I truly believe I am the exception, with most other students having to deviate from their carefully planned timetables due to the school's failings.","I took a second major and we were supposed to have priority for course slots as we had to load cores, sometimes with only 1 specific slot available.\n\nThe NTU admin didnt even release normal course slots during our designated bidding time so there were no alots available even though no one else had registered yet.\n\nIf this isnt gross incompetence, i dont know what is.","alumni here. during my time, NTU had nothing. for eg there were only tables and chairs for students at Canteen B there.

Then, the school sent many express red shuttle buses at that time(I stay at Saraca Hall). What a stupid arrangement!","@Zeropauper There's another issue that I think needs attending to. \n\nNTU has a severe lack of halal food throughout the whole campus [especially at South Spine]. As majority of my lessons are in South Spine with short breaks in between, I can't really be going all the way to North Spine to eat peacefully without rushing for my next class. However, from what I recall, the only halal food available at South Spine is \n\n- Co-Op (western)\n- A Nasi Padang? Stall without halal certification\n- Stale vending machine sandwiches\n\n\nThere may be more i haven't eat at yet but as you can see, there's clearly a lack of halal stalls.\nThis also shows in the fact that us Muslims have to rely on Instagram pages such as https:\/\/instagram.com\/ntu_halal_eateries?utm_medium=copy_link just to find halal food. \n\nThe article below summarises the problems we face and NTU clearly doing nothing about it (congruent to the issues you brought up to!) \nhttp:\/\/www.nanyangchronicle.ntu.edu.sg\/news\/2505halal.html\n\nBesides, non-muslims can equally enjoy halal food so it's not like only us Muslims will be buying from these stores.

To me the biggest infrastructure joke is The Hive. It's well known as a \"tourist-attracting\" spot and has lots of tutorial rooms (big and small) for lessons. The Hive starts from level B5 to level 3, 8 floors in total, and has 3 lifts servicing the whole building. There's a few entrance points for the Hive but most common is the one at B4 and B5. However, I've come across various times where lessons are held on level 2 or level 3, which is at the very top, but when you enter the building from level B4 or B5 and attempt to take the lifts you instead end up taking the stairs. The lifts are ancient and move very slow. Whenever we attempt to take the lifts, they are either full or move very slowly, which is why it would be faster to just take the stairs. My friends and I have concluded that NTU only invested into the design of the building and not the lifts. Before anyone says strawberry or entitled, think \"Would you want to go climbing 6-8 flights of stairs for your lessons while carrying your bags and laptop, especially when most often your rushing to your next lesson in Hive from another building.\"","I wasn't a student at NTU, but I've had to attend quite a few programmes there over the years.

I was in OCS 5 years ago and my wing (company) was about to set off on a 16km route March. One of my platoon mates had a slight fever and headache and we told him to rest and fall out. But being the OCS cadet he was, he wanted to push on. Our wing commander then came down to inspect us and when he saw that my platoon mate was looking, unwell, he asked him if he was feeling okay. When the wing commander found out he had a fever, he stopped everything and shouted \"FUXK YOU YOU UNDERSTAND! SAFETY IS FCKING IMPORTANT AND IF YOU ARE FEELING UNWELL YPU BETTER FKING FALL OUT!\" He then lectured our whole platoon about the importance of safety and looking out for one another, and eventually for our fellow NSF when we enter into the units.

Root cause analysis can undercover latent conditions contributing to the incident.

And each counsellor is also unique in his\/her ways of implementing each approach. Saying this is like stereotyping an entire race based on one individual, or saying that all guys\/girls are hopeless based on one failed Tinder date.

It is not like one can just suddenly get afflicted with a mental disorder (like getting covid), but there are multiple biological, psychological, social and cultural factors that can predispose, trigger and\/or perpetuate the condition.

It's really jarring and discourages you from wanting to visit IMH again, also contributes to the inner stigma you already have about the place.

I moved overseas in 2019 and since then, I actually started going regularly to therapy because 1) the stigma isn't there, people openly talk about it and 2) it's much cheaper than in Singapore, and it helped me so much.","[deleted]","EDIT:\nI saw that my comment was highlighted on OP\u2019s post.

Life will always be difficult, work will always be tough and family will continue to be estranged for some time\u2026 it\u2019s a long process before you notice improvements, and takes so much patience and resilience to work through all of that.

They don't have overwhelming physical symptoms like a physical illness - and more often than not people tend to hide these 'symptoms' of disinterest, low energy, and unwillingness to participate in activities due to the discrimination in society.","Thanks OP for this. Aside from the specifics of this case which are too early for us to discuss on, I think it's very true that being open about mental health is becoming increasingly important. \n\nI once heard from a psychiatrist specialising with children that building resilience and having support in place are the most important defences against children choosing to take their own lives, or to take lives lightly. Without a healthy goal in life and appropriate doses of small failures and successes, it can become a time bomb that children may either end up not being able to take set-backs or feel that their life is not worthwhile. So it's not just a matter of putting protective bubbles around children, but giving children the space and time to learn about life, develop some goals and aspirations (not tied to their parents') and then have successes and failures along the way to build resilience and find meaning. I believe the older generations don't quite understand how the younger folks feel these days partly coz in the past, hardship was generally the norm, and you'd just suck it up. Whoever's survived till today would be somewhat resilient, and not understand well why the younger generations are \"strawberry\". \n\nThe best wine and durians come from vines and trees growing on slopes and having to fight for water and experience hardship. But that doesn't mean the farmer doesn't take care of the area to prevent pests and extreme situations.","Unfortunately a lot of parents want to hide the fact that their children need help, almost in a sort of constant denial. Workplaces and society at large, I feel, are also in denial, and all these many hands clap to create a huge stigma towards mental illness, and is causing those who need help to retreat even further. and speculation is adding to the stigma, a lot of people that have brought up the news of this incident to me immediately add on that they're so sure that he had schizo and voices in his head were telling him to kill someone, its horrifyingly sad how one-track minded people are, and how thick the bubble they're in to have such thought processes.\n\nI used to work in a company that happened to hire a twenty-something exec who had a history of depression when he was 16-19years old, was exempted from NS, he did not reveal this during his interview and was hired (sure, one can blame HR for doing a terrible job of resume vetting, again, easy to shift blame). He was on medication for quite awhile and seemed to get better (from the meds I'm sure, his parents were clearly never supportive and always held their other \"normal\" sons in higher regard, which I'm sure only made him feel worse), and his parents just let him \"go back\" into the society and hopefully hold a job, almost as if convincing themselves that the mental health issues could be wished or faded away with time. After 5 months scaring off potential clients with his strange talk (he affected everyone in the office with his constant pacing, quoting movies that he's watched, a bunch of other strange behaviour that caused everyone to basically shun him completely), the management promptly said they couldn't confirm his probation (which came across to me as \"yeah lets drop the problematic one and lets hire another replacement\"), and he left, sadly much to the relief of everyone (it felt like everyone was celebrating his departure). One day, he suddenly made an appearance again at the office sweaty and cryi","Can we also start legislating laws that helps in mental health in work too.

Family environment taught me that if I wanted my way, I have to shout at people, just like how mom and dad acted.\n\nIt's true that no amount of psychologists\/psychiatrists\/counsellors can fix a mental health issue, you need a support circle and the environment around you matters. I had a very good counsellor during secondary school, who genuinely went out of her way to help me, like sitting with me during recess to eat (because nobody wants to eat with me). But I still felt like shit, because my \"other classmates\" aren't sitting with an adult eating, they are sitting with friends or out in the field playing soccer. I felt like an outcast. Clearly it didn't help me \"get out of depression\".\n\nI'd describe it this way: every time I left the counsellor's office, I felt like super happy. But that happiness subsides and goes away once I go back to the classroom, because my classmates wouldn't talk to me. They don't want to be friends because they know that I tend to burst into fits of rage if I felt extreme loneliness. They didn't want to give me another chance.

Every time I hear that from people (usually when I post emo insta stories), I feel triggered. My insta story saying \"Lonely\" is a plea for people to come up and strike a conversation, especially since proactively reaching out and getting \"Seen\" or no response is a kick in the stomach, making my mind think I truly am destined to be lonely. I know when my emotional state is starting to turn shit and it's my way to cry for help without getting myself emotionally hurt.\n\nAlso, don't use rat race\/grades\/pressure cooker education system as a way to absolve your own res","Life is an irony.

Days later, a group of five individuals protested against MOE's handling of the case outside its building in Buona Vista. Three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit.\n\nWhen the issue was raised in Parliament on Feb 1, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student, parents and doctors, and MOE did not have purview over them. He expressed concern that gender identity issues have become \"bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some Western countries and societies\".\n\nHe added: \"We should not import these culture wars into Singapore, or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society.\"\n\nCultural imports?\n\nIndeed, in the United States and Britain, fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports, military service and gender-segregated spaces like bathrooms.\n\nBut it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in Singapore, they are considered on their own merit, and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas.\n\nMr Wong's cautionary note about ","By Rei Kurohi, one of the few legit journalists here.","Reposting from the previous thread\n\n__________\n\nTrans people have been a large part of Singapore society going as far back as the 1950s - 1980s. See [Bugis Street](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bugis,_Singapore#1950s%E2%80%931980s). \n\nThe first sex change operation in Asia was done in Singapore. It was based on a technique invented by Benjamin Sheares, who also served as our second president, then adapted by S Shan Ratnam for transsexuals. Singapore was renowned in Asia for having the most skilled surgeons with regards to transgender surgeries up until the early 1990s. Transexuals have been legally allowed to change their sex and have been able to legally marry the opposite sex since the 1970s.\n\nIf anything, Singapore has imported the conservative, transphobic attitudes of Christian fundamentalists from the west, which led to the government cleansing and eradicating our trans culture.\n\nSupporting transsexuals and their rights would simply be reverting our country's stance on trans people back to what it was before we \"imported\" conservative Christian attitudes from the west.\n\nThe largest cultural wars that have been imported were those waged by fundamentalist Christians. Yet for some fucking sad irony, it is these same people who seem to be under the misbelief that their \"traditional\" cultures and values are under attack by \"the western liberals\".","I may not be transgender, but i can empathize.

Anyone shd be able to wear whatever they want to school as long as it covers them decently.","Reposting my comments from the previous thread: \n\nWell-written article! I certainly agree that there needs to be more conversations in this area. Dismissing transgender issues as mere \u201cculture wars\u201d does not help, as doing so just further widens the us vs them divide. Gender identity issues are a concern that encompasses the entire human race and are most certainly not a \u201cEast vs West\u201d difference in ideology. \n\nThe other aspect that concerns me is the delay in education that such individuals face in the two examples listed. For a country that prides itself on having some of the highest education standards on the global stage, the recent stance taken by the government with regards to this incident sure is a disappointing one to take.","Its a really well-written article, and I hope that our society becomes more inclusive over time. I recall a few years ago when MOH\/HPB had an online infographic about trans\/LGBT health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society. So sometimes, we can't expect ministries or govt to \"take the lead\", because there has been more than one time when ministries are progressive but get whacked by society. \n\nI do have one gripe about this article, which is this: \n\n\"To avoid a culture war, these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology\". \n\nScience does have a role in addressing some of these questions, but at the end of the day, morality and ethics has to answer the most important parts. And it's bad to shove it all to science and technocrats, because science doesn't have these answers. \n\nFor example, there is a question as to whether should minors be allowed to go through permanent procedures. Science can't answer such a question. Science can tell us that gender dysphoria is a mental health condition, but science won't tell you that the best way to address this is by allowing procedures for minors. Society has to determine what should be the limits of consent. And while a 'culture war' fuelled by ignorance is bad, a debate about ethics and morality should be viewed as a good thing.

The purpose of a carbon tax is to simply let the pricing of things to reflect its real cost, the existence of alternatives is no reason against such a tax. In fact, carbon tax is *the* best solution to climate change.\n\nCorporations are incentivized to seek other production methods to reduce their cost, which will eventually provide alternatives and thus fulfilling the purpose of the tax.

Sure, we could try and tap geothermal plants in Indonesia, but that leaves us dangerously reliant on a neighbor who historically, we have not had the best of relationships with. They could decide to lock us out at any time. Wave power also does not work, for the simple reason that we do not face the ocean. As for wind energy?

You giving them waste paper, plastic bottles, and cardboard is precisely the kind of virtue signalling you so happily criticise others for; the only real way to reduce your carbon footprint in Singapore, in terms of waste, is simply to reduce the shit you buy.

And that will, in no small part, be due to climate change. \n\nOn the non-climate change aspect, we have China and its One Belt, One Road Policy, which is developing ports in Malacca to serve as a waypoint on its trade routes. This will inevitably reduce shipping traffic passing through Singapore, reducing our profits from Bunkering. There isn't much that we can do about this, besides suck it up. \n\nOn the climate-change aspect, we have the melting Arctic, which is opening up new, more efficient sea-trading routes. The worlds biggest emitters, especially the US and Russia, have a vested interest in this happening, as not only will they be able to utilize these new trade routes, they would also be interested in exerting sovereign rights over the marine resources in this region.

They deserve the flak they are getting now","Just speaking from my experience in the Bay Area, we use the Clipper card there and the card does allow you top up online and it displays the fare when you tap-in\/out. But if you do top-up online, it takes ages for the fare to get topped up and sometimes if you don't tap early enough, you can be stuck outside the gantry till it is updated. Not defending the systems here (honestly US and SG public transport can't even compared, it's so much better in sg for sure), but I can see why we don't get to instantly see the fares for simply go.\n\nBut why this whole saga is controversial is because we already can see the fares as we tap-in\/out and the existing system has been working well, so why are we forced to migrate to a system that is more regressive? And my bigger gripe is why is the whole smart-card system so fragmented here? Suica cards are so prevalent and useful in Japan and likewise for Octopus cards in HK. Ez-Link itself is so limited in what we can do and NETS Flashpay cards imo are a lot better, but a lot of shop owners and consumers aren't even aware that they can be widely used. I think there are 2 things LTA must do going forward:  \n\\- Design simplygo cards to display fares and balance  \n\\- Simplygo cards should be widely accepted across the island in addition to existing credit\/debit cards","SimplyGo was never designed with stored value cards in mind. As a long time user of SimplyGo via credit card, you were never shown how much you paid per trip until it was consolidated at the end of day. This lazy  logic would require effort to change and maybe incur more cost to the payment merchants, which is probably why they didn't do it. \n\nMy guess is they simply plugged a square peg into a round hole and expected people to just accept it.","Some points I'd like to add:\n\n- Card can be topped up not at a machine, [we literally invented auto top ups in the 90s](https:\/\/eresources.nlb.gov.sg\/newspapers\/digitised\/article\/biztimes19940714-1.2.12.7), albeit with GIRO\n\n- London has the ability to magically update the card with the new balance computed by the server, but we apparently can't. When LTA\/TL made a mistake with the fares for TEL3, ez-link users had to go to a machine to redeem their refunds. https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/singapore\/1335-trips-thomson-east-coast-line-tel-orchard-station-and-queenstown-station-charged-extra-6-cents-3143381\n\n- It's thus likely possible to hack together something with the auto top up technology that allows the legacy system to \"sync\" the card data with what's in the database, but that's a lot more expensive and still requires pinging the server.\n\n- You can't write to bank cards and they obviously don't need to keep a value, so it ends there.\n\n[Wrote more here](https:\/\/medium.com\/from-the-red-line\/the-payment-ecosystem-15610928ccca).

Instead they bombarded me with a ton of questions about how I found out about their gym etc and pushed for me to come for a free training class and \u201cdiscuss package options later\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s bad enough for me","I'll be pissed if I'm paying so much and spend half the time doing warm up and cardio instead of spending time with the instructor. \n\nMy old gym expects you to reach half hour early to warm up, shadow box, and be gloved up when lessons start at the scheduled time.","Read all the comments here and agree with 99.9% of them.\n\nI used to be in the back office, so this is what we see BTS. Everything you read and watch that is Evolve-branded has to go through me first.\n\nEvolve is 100% corporate. Don't delude yourself that it's a homey gym etc. There's always a focus on revenue (fair enough since its a business) rather than improving the learning experience for current members. When I was there, we were always talking about selling more and more of the Evolve University video packages, tickets to live fights and recruiting new members.\n\nDuring my time, there was absolutely no mention or discussion about level 2\/3 MT students. Senior management is always asking how we can get more new members. It's absolutely like a pyramid scheme: more new suckers to prop up the entire wobbly structure. Why else do you get so many overpriced seminars?\n\nThe culture you experience is a direct result of how things are run. The good instructors leave because they're SEVERELY overworked. \n\nExample is Nong O. Teaches classes in the day and trains for his fights between classes. Then he's tapped to record videos for Evolve University, Evolve's YouTube and other promo material because he's THE face of MT and Evolve. A lot of the University videos are shot after the gym is closed i.e. they only start around 11-12 am and shoot till 4-5 am. I don't think he's paid extra for all this shit. This shit happens pretty much every 2-3 weeks or so.\n\nHow to keep up with this pace? No time for yourself, much less your family. So when Nong O left, someone else has to take his place.\n\nThere's no incentive for Evolve to help you grow. In the back office, there's a standing order to complete over 120 pieces of content (2-3 YT videos, 3 newsletters, 7x blog posts and 7x social media posts PER week among other things) a month for a gym. Your fees are spent on paying senior management to slave drive the back office staff rather than improving your learning experience. Other than ","Opinions not welcome in evolve. Hope you find other place to train","I've heard similar stuff from several people who have tried training MT at Evolve. \n\nThe complaints I've heard are that the trainers are just going thru the motions, there is little camaraderie among the students, and lackluster interactions between the students and trainers. \n\nThey also lamented the \"corporate\" culture of the gym, and how it tended to attract the atas kind of crowd, which definitely affects the gym culture. Lots of expats and wealthy corporate types. The only people I could see training there would probably be professionals, and amateurs who have the money to spend to feel like they get a \"premium\" experience.\n\nHonestly never considered training there after seeing their prices. They do have some badass trainers though, can't deny that. Their gyms also look damn well maintained and clean. However shiny everything is, in the end it's the culture and people who make the gym what it is.","I have been training at evolve with my gf for more than 5 years. We left in 2022 because of the poor service and many great instructors leaving (e.g. Kru Yod)\n\nPreviously, whenever it\u2019s near the membership renewal, the salesperson would contact me to renew (plus additional renewal benefits). \n\nBut this time they didn\u2019t care to notify me, I didn\u2019t know my contract ended, only found out when I couldn\u2019t login to book classes, emailed and called them but no response. \n\nThe funny thing is, a few weeks later they kept spam emailing me with \u201cWe Miss You at Evolve\u201d promotion emails.\n\nI haven\u2019t found another gym yet but am considering Pineapple. I saw many ex-evolve members going there.","So I joined Evolve last year. I've been trying out different time slots, and I find the instructors absolutely tailor their classes based on who shows up. The evening slots get a ton of beginners and irregular members (like me :() - and I definitely see them ease up on the training so as not to discourage the newbies.\n\nIt's a tough balance, honestly. Popular gyms like Evolve are always going to get droves of newcomers, who far outnumber the advanced folks. I think it's less about milking money from \"rich Singaporeans\/foreigners\", but more adapting to the clientele who show up.\n\nThat said, I'm checking the app right now, and I see way more beginner slots - like, three in a row for tomorrow! Clearly accommodating for the New Year Resolution crowd.\n\nI think your criticism is valid, and I also think it's not a knock on Evolve.

He said that if I don't do the procedure, eventually my jaw will be deformed and will have jaw problems when I'm in middle ages. That fear mongering plus the fact that I was self conscious about my teeth was why I forked out the money (which isn't easy as an NSF). It took a few months of check ups before the procedure. During the post check up (after 7 months later), he told me I may need to do the same procedure with the other tooth. So far, this dentist was nice and seemed to care about my well being so I thought why not. (I was already working a full time job so I had more disposable income)\n\nIt just so happened that my company offers a benefit in dental visits, but only on hospital so I decided to use it. I asked the dentist in that hospital to see if I can do the surgical procedure there (since the benefit will cover me) and he actually said that I didn't really need it and there was no clinical indication that I have to had that procedure. It was entirely cosmetic. I was so mad. \n\nFinding out later, dental students actually did this type of coaxing since the school doesn't provide them with patients for clinical experience.

It has grown from strength to strength since. Approximately, 28,000 attended Pink dot in recent years, before covid.\n\n2012: Tan Eng Hong was charged with Section 377A. The charge was later dropped.\n\n2018: Diplomat Tommy Koh and former Attorney-General Walter Woon have called on members of the LGBT community to challenge the law.\n\n2019: Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act was amended to protect the LGBT community from religiously-motivated violence.\n\nSocially, the support for equality for LGBT is also growing steadily over the same period.\n\n2005: NTU poll. 69% negatively, whilst 23% positively.\n\n2010: NTU poll. 64.5% negatively and 25% positively.\n\n2013: IPS poll. 78% of Singaporeans opposed same-sex marriage. 10% said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time.  15% support same-sex marriage.\n\n2019: YouGov poll. 43% opposed their legalization, and the remaining 23% were uncertain.\n\nIPS survey. 60% of Singaporeans opposed same-sex marriage.\n\nBlackbox survey. 55% of Singaporeans opposed same-sex marriage.\n\nIn short, much has happened in the past 11 years.

He then got angry and asked me to move. Not only to move away or swap places with him, but specifically wanted me to move to the rear of the bus. Why? Because he wanted to stand in my spot. I couldn\u2019t get angry also because again,  judgemental public. I mean the bus was packed!? Even if I wanted to, I can\u2019t even go to the rear.\n\nBut to balance things out, I have had good experiences with elderly on public transport too. Like the one time I was coughing badly due to the haze and this auntie suddenly gave me a few cough sweets and asked me to drink more water. Or when it was raining heavily and you know how the aunties will open their umbrellas for the short walk up the bus? This random auntie insisted I should board the bus with her & her umbrella because \u201crain will make you sick\u201d.","Since I do not live in Singapore, this is a bit of insight into your daily lives for me. I'm sorry you experienced that.","Almost every time I take public transport. Cutting queues, rushing for seats etc.\n\nAnd we all just keep quiet because of the whole respect your elders thing and most locals don't really speak up","If old people can weaponize their age to get seats, surely I can weaponize philosophy to argue why they shouldn\u2019t do that right? \n\nProbably should start forming rebuttals next time an entitled old person asks for something. ","On the flip side of the story, sometimes you also get the younger fellas doing the same thing... So this issue of self entitlement is not solely confined to only the elderly. Self-entitled youth, grows up into a self-entitled adult, and then into a self-entitled elderly. There may be more in certain age groups but I think it has largely to do with one's character. I have no source to support my comments as I pretty much pull them out from the nether region. ","Frankly speaking, I don't see why pioneers should be given any special attention or privileges. Let's face it. The vast majority of older folks in their 50-60s who take public transport haven't really achieved anything special to warrant special treatment. They're tiny, insignificant gears in a machine just like anyone else, and their economic contribution is probably a lot less than anyone of the current generation. If you're someone who made it, who contributed very significantly to the economy, arts or is noteworthy for other achievements, you deserve that distinction of a pioneer. If not, you're no better than anyone else."],"585":["It's true that you could have confronted him or made a scene. But de-escalation is also valid and sometimes the most prudent option. \n\nI've encountered people like this in Singapore and other countries who threaten aggression and\/or violence towards me. I think the important part is taking emotion out of it and recognising my personal choice to de-escalate. \n\nWe *could* have escalated but made the explicit choice not to, which is completely fine. Things to consider like what if the uncle got physically violent towards you, what if he had a weapon, could you defend yourself against him alone, if not, what if nobody stands up to help you?\n\nWalking away removes all these what-ifs and prioritises your safety, so it's a great decision imo. 99% of people I know who have trained in any real martial art will choose to walk away for these reasons. So despite choosing not to engage, you shouldn't think of yourself as a victim, rather a smart person who actively made the choice to de-escalate.\n\nI also feel shaken up after these experiences but I hope you can find solace in knowing that you made an intelligent decision despite being under pressure in a dangerous situation\n\nEdit: I just read the last part of your post. I'm really sorry that happened to you. If it helps, some of my female friends who have had similar experiences have shared that learning a self-defence martial art has helped them deal with their trauma to some degree.

Its viewed as an exclusive, high-class position and if you managed to become one means that you are a considered of high social standing. \n\nI think its derived from the fact that many people of the time back then saw the profession as basically the best of the best of hospitality service and being able to fly to many countries regularly was a big flex. To add on, air stewards were chosen for their physical appearance as well (height, face, posture etc) so there was a belief that if you were chosen meant you were very good looking which adds to the social standing.\n\nNowadays, I think most of us know that air stewards are treated quite poorly (like atas waiters basically), work long, inflexible hours, and have to spend a lot of time away from home, on top of having to keep up with appearances for many hours on end. \n\nThe only ones who still regard air stewards as a \"premium or lucrative\" occupation are those that have no idea the struggles of those actually in the industry.","A relative was working as an air stewardess when she met a rich man\u2019s son while working a flight. \n\nThey dated, got married and started a family.

If he continues to pursue OP, then that's definitely being very very stalkerish.\n\nWith that said, I find the thread to be very one-sided. It's all describing how the guy is creepy, stalkerish, and insane. And there's not really any discussion on what exactly the guy did that is considered creepy and stalkerish. It makes the thread look as if any guy shooting their shot WILL be considered creepy, which is probably not the case. \n\nIt could be said that the guy in OP's post is just incredibly socially awkward and is following some pick-up artist's advice of shooting their shot. They just chose one of the most socially unacceptable ways to do it.\n\nI think the main problem here is that if someone is busy getting to their destination, following them is a huge red flag. No matter if you're a guy or a girl, if you're walking and someone is following you, you would probably be very very weirded out.

You can consult with the contractor yourself but it would be tedious.\n\nDon't think it's a criminal offence to mark-up prices. Middle man always mark up prices, no matter what they say.

TBH, ID shopping is something one should do and if they don't give invoice or they say they don't earn markups or commission, they must be lying lol.\n\nHonestly, if you really want to reduce the cost and still get an ID, then you will need to find your own suppliers, buy from them and then let your ID project manage.\n\nActually, what I don't get is usually if you have a more or less fixed idea of what you want the ID to do, the price quoted is usually around that ball park. If it balloons, it is usually because the client wants to add more stuff into the house","You can, engage, negotiate, monitor contractors yourself.

Only engaged an ID to do the design and rendering. Overall, I would say I saved a bit of money (37k all in for 2 bed + study resale condo) but we spent most of our weekends handling the renovation, looking for materials and lights, etc. It\u2019s really about how much time you want to commit vs convenience.","As someone from the build environment industry, I feel the crux of the problem lies in the lack of certification or profession practice in ID as an industry. \n\nArchitects, Landscape Architects, Engineers, they are all govern by a profession code and certification. Interior Designers don't, and as such any Tom Dick or Harry who think they have a inkling of design aesthetic, can be called an Interior designer.

But you are basically complaining that you paid too much for a shitty ID and are demanding \"regulation\". \n\nWhat regulation are you looking for? This is what the market is like. This is why you need to ID shop (compare between IDs), bargain with the ID (be insistent, be thick skinned, demand everything in writing), be prepared to walk if you can't get what you want, inspect all of the work as and when it is done, demand invoices for everything. Push, push, push back right at them.\n\nEverybody is hustling to make that sale. The ID *must* eat a profit, else they go out of business. How much of a profit they make is partly up to you. Don't give in. Be persistent. \n\nI am sorry nobody taught you this lesson before you had to learn it directly yourself with your hard earned money on your new home, souring that new home feel and what ought to have been a happy occasion of renovation completion. I totally sympathise, I know it must feel terrible. \n\nThe most important thing right now is to *inspect and document the work they have done for you*. Make sure it is in line with what they quoted. If the work is done, which is what it sounds like, inspect and use everything, make sure it works. Take photos - not just of the working things but of all the things. Hopefully it is all working and good. Hopefully you had the presence of mind to keep track of things as they were working on your home. Do you know where they laid new pipe? New power points? Make sure you know and jot it down somewhere.","Am an interior designer (ID) myself, in fact I've recently started my own company. \n\nJust want to emphasize that I'm not here to advertise my company or anything like that. And I'm also aware of the stigma attached to IDs.\n\n But truthfully speaking the main point to me has always been making sure the client\/homeowners move in happily. That's what I love about my job. Seeing my clients move in happily with their significant other into their first home. Or helping an older couple spruce up their retirement home.\nThese moments are what make the job a fulfilling one. \n\nMoving on, I don't want to take sides but personally I don't agree with the way your ID handled things based on what you mentioned. While yes, of course she has a right to earn she had already done that through the 15k project management fee which is a lot in my opinion. But of course depends on what type of works you did and type of home it is.\nThe whole invoice shenanigans is honestly just plain misleading. It was just a ruse, and a really sly one at that. \n\nThat being said, of course I mark up lah haha. I too have to feed my family. And also after all it's a creative process where I pour in hours upon hours of designing, planning, coordinating and executing. But I just mark up. No project management fee. The mark up is what I earn. The project management is part of my job. It justifies the mark up. \n\nAnd I read a comment that said IDs earn about 45%? While I'm sure some do. I can assure you that definitely not all do. That's like insane for the average consumer. I won't reveal what I mark up. But it ain't 45%. \n\nYes there are IDs out there simply looking to make a quick buck. But there are IDs out there who are also sincere and earnest.\n\nTo me I'd rather do my best for my client so that I can photoshoot the home and add it to my portfolio. Plus a job well done usually also means referrals and a good review. It's a win-win situation for everyone this way. \n\nPlease feel free to let me know if you have an","Recently joined this Industry so I'll like to share a bit on what I have encountered and learnt. Initially, I applied as a tradesman. Figured I do carpentry which is something I do quite enjoy. The Covid situation did quite a number on every industry and so it didnt happen. Then I came across my friend post looking for people to join him and now im ID\/contracter\/handyman.  \n\nFirst of all Id like to talk a little bit on marking up. Im sure most of you have seen items such as loading and unloading, Area protection, disposal of debris and so on. These are actually being used as it is, unfortunately sometimes things go wrong such as materials too big to fit into the lift, 1 floor up is $10 and if you live on the 15th floor that is easily 150 for every item that has to be manually carried up. Of course as a consumer nobody likes to hear things like oh we had to pay extra for this cost comes back to you so end up most of the time ID firms eat this cost. So typically they mark up is to cover for these kind of scenario but if you are experienced enough, all of these would have been planned (Project management skills here!) So I can see why some ID do charge on Project management, but looking at your case where you are charged both PM and markup, then yea you have been carroted.\n\nOn using your own subcons and buying of miscellaneous. Quite frankly it is more of a matter of convenience to me although I do hear of stories from subcons of how ID markup their services. But the main point is this. If you happen to buy an oven with one of our suppliers and it dosent fit, then we can easily change it, if you do on your own then that is where the headache comes. Although flexibility is important and I always tell my clients if you dont see anything that fits what you like then please do check out other options. At the end of the day, it is a home that they will come back to and it is important that they are happy with it.\n\nNext thing I want to talk about is quotation. I am not afrai","This is not just present in the ID industry, but actually everywhere you go.

I was fortunate enough, as a admin commander, and through knowing the correct clerks to understand the process and assist others.\n\nAfter posting my guide in March 2019, I would receive PMs on a regular basis of NSFs requesting help on how they could get service injury coverage, and to hear their stories was heartbreaking cos I could only guide them and not assist them in any more meaningful manner.\n\nThis would stop in June 2020 (think carefully of what was held in Singapore then), when I got a call from MINDEF asking me if I could remove the post as they did not want the information to be this transparent. I simply deleted the account, but left the post up. None of the information is secret, as I simply pieced the puzzle, and I made pains to ensure no confidential info was pit up. This is the moment that enrages and makes me lose all hope in our institutions, as they bothered to spend the effort to track me down and request taking down information that so many of us needed, but did not bother to fix the underlying issues that caused them, leaving thousands of us injured and financially disadvantaged.\n\nFor all their rhetoric, they clearly do not care about the welfare of Singaporean men, we are j","My friends headphone earplug thingy came out during live firing and he now has permanent hearing loss .

I also feel like some injuries would only present symptoms or show signs much later after ORD, like my ankle.

I was good enough to help out and not be incompetent. I had some minor problems with the sergeants, two of them being extremely strict but at least not completely unreasonable, though they have brought me to tears a few times (which is still too much imo). But my section mates berate me for sleeping with my locker opened (lock was on, but not locked, so unnoticable at a glance) when they did the exact same thing. I literally saw them go to sleep, some with their lockers wide open. I just had the misfortune of no one watching my back when I did the same thing, and they stole my rifle and hid it in their locker. Only when I went down to talk to the sergeants did they come and stop me mid-conversation, because they don't want to be punished for what they did.\n\nThose assholes can rot in hell. I developed so much anxiety from that and other incidents that I never truly recovered from, only adapted to after years away from NS. My mental health was in shambles and I almost became the 3rd NSF to shoot myself in a month because I just wanted to end it all. Super damn easy when I was in charge of holding the keys to the bullets and rifle cabinet, and I told myself if any single bad thing happened that day, it was go time. Thankfully, everyone in my post was so much better than my BMT shithead section mates, my mistakes were forgiven and they helped cover my ass instead of blasting it and by the 12th hour in my 24 hour shift, I was somewhat better and decided I was going to be OK that day. I honestly felt like the entire world was greyscaled and I ","As mentioned here. The mental health impact of NS cannot be underestimated. \n\nDuring the days of the founding of NS, mental health isn\u2019t a topic well understood. And even today, our culture does not really understand mental health much dismissing it as just being weak. \n\nI\u2019ve seen people who graduated from poly with high hopes of furthering their studies and achieving much in life only for the 2 years road bump to break them down relegating them to menial roles. \n\nYes. I understand that there are people who continues to be successful after NS but not everyone is mentally strong enough to continue doing so. \n\nNot everyone is mentally stable enough to be in such a regimental place. And the lack of manpower has continued to pushed people who should have gotten a PES F for their mental health issue into admin role and some in combat role with a gun. \n\nI would not be surprise if we hear a case or two of people committing suicide while in NS.","Mostly mental. I went in as a happy 18 year old with no mental health issues and came out with quite a number.\n\nI remembered people telling me it's good to go because you'll \"learn to be a real man\" and meet new people. \nI did not feel any more manly and I did not make any friends. I despised my 2 years thrown away for something that barely yielded anything for my benefit.","I want to bring to attention the mental toll and issues that comes with serving as well. A significant amount of enlistees struggle with anxiety and depression from having two years taken away. Those with 5 days in camp and 2 out also struggle a lot with having a social lifestyle. Their friends are either in uni or unable to meet up which causes loneliness. Romantic pursuits are much more difficult as well. The sacrifice of enlistees are not something to be understated. A lot of these mental issues can last post ORD or become lifelong especially those with genetic triggers or susceptible to depression\/anxiety. There's no proper compensation or support for mental illness post ORD.\n\nPlease note my comments are anecdotal and not scientifically\/statistically backed up.","I smashed my knees into the low wall multiple times during SOC during BMT. My knee hurt so much afterwards that I was on crutches for a week. When I posted to my unit, my knee continued to hurt more and I went to see a specialist. \n\nI was diagnosed with chronic quadriceps tendinitis. MRI scans showed little to no cartilage in my knees. Immediately my PES was dropped to B4 and I was permanently excused from RMJ and Lower Limbs. I only ORDed on 19 April 2022.

I cannot stand it when people say it. I am proud of my service but some people really need to shut the fuck up. I get into arguments with my mother about how shitty the pay is. It\u2019s funny because she keeps trying to rationalize it as a form of service when she hasn\u2019t done a single day of NS. She keeps saying \u201coh a US Marine has it worse because he actually goes off to war.\u201d My rationale in response is that he has a choice to go into the Marines and is paid a decent wage while I\u2019m not. I also bring up the point that I *wanted* to sign on. \n\nI\u2019m leaving for university in the UK soon and I\u2019ve only just made up my mind that I\u2019ll do my best to stay there and find a job.

Everyone is conscripted or no one is.\n\nAnd my mother can wonder why every single guy I know complains about NS.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that when I went to see the MO the first time for my knee, he low-key accused me of malingering and asked if I was doing it to get out of IPPT.

Permanent damage.\n\nCome to think of it, 3 of my friends have the same injury, all in different combat vocations but all involve carrying\/maneuvering heavy loads in the field.","I was in Tekong for exercise, carrying 84 manpack, fell with my leg straightened, torn my ACL (half torn). That's not the bad part.\n\nI had to hobble to the main road, and then the RSM had a look at me, saw that I could still stand up (nobody knew it was ACL until we reached the medical centre), refused to let me go in the rover, so I had to walk about 2km to where we ended the exercise, despite having a busted leg. This took 2 hours, I was helped by 2 people from my section, someone found a huge stick for me to use as a walking stick, while a few others had to carry all our gear (this is all 84 so I'd say about 120kg of extra load for those poor people as well).\n\nThat's the drama one. I also had a back injury (later diagnosed as a compressed disc in my lower back) due to constantly having to carry these heavy loads (mainly 84, but also SPIKE and MG on occasion). Many times, since people being unwell is a common thing for us heavy weapons people, we often had to carry other people's loads, which meant that pretty much everyone had some sort of back problem.\n\nOnce during a 24km route march (once again carrying the manpack), I had heat exhaustion. The medic failed to find my veins, so after poking both my arms twice each he gave up and I just drank some 100 Plus.\n\nTo end off with a less serious and more whiny one, during the search for MSK, we had long days of heavy rain and bashing through actual swamps (did you know we have so much swamps in Singapore? I didn't!), which meant that we had a full week of damp boots, naturally leading to severe foot rot for pretty much all of us to varying degrees. When we went back to camp, our boots were all stuffed with newspaper to dry them, but they're not dry at all when we have to wear them again, because of the short turnaround. We often reached back in camp around 10pm, sleep around 11pm, wake up 4.30am, out we went again. To add on the whiny bit, some days we had to do cordon at night, which meant out in the forests all night,","Since this is a serious flaired discussion, will share more about my experience.\n\nDuring my time in army I sustained moderate to severe hearing loss after live firing exercises. Currently have to wear hearing aids for the rest of my life, since you can\u2019t recover hearing loss. Had to downpes and also suffered from the whole \u201cvocation to promote\u201d bullshit. \n\nSo what happens in the army in terms of promotion, if you are just a normal private->LCP->CPL guy. Once you are assigned to a unit\/vocation, you have to serve 6 months at your current rank+unit to qualify for a promotion in the system. I was 5 months into my unit when I got the downpes letter. My platoon mates all got promoted to LCP, while I got assigned to HQ and was reclassified vocation. Because of this, my 6 months timer got reset, and I was stuck at my PTE rank. This cost me about $150\/month extra from the LCP pay I would have gotten (and subsequently CPL extra pay). Barely made CPL in time for my ORD. This is one way which enlistees get screwed by the rigid system due to something out of their control.\n\nThe claim process took almost 4 years for army to finally process, and they issued a service injury card and paid compensation.\n\nMy yearly medical appointments are covered by service injury card. All hearing aids related costs, if prescribed by the specialist\/audiologist, is covered. \n\nCompensation wise, I found out that the army actually buys the Workman Injury Compensation (wica insurance) on servicemen. So injured claimants who make a claim from the army are technically claiming from Wica insurance. What the army then does is they have a Fund of their own that matches 1-1 of the payout from wica, if any. So if your injury qualifies for a 5k payout, you get another 5k from this army fund. You also sign a discharge form, to waive all future claims against the army.\n\nI\u2019m doing well now, but dealing with all these factors and also losing a long term relationship while I was in the army caused me to suffer fro","When peacetime training leads to so many long term injuries... something is probably wrong.

The pain came back and finally I literally felt my guys fall through the wall that held my guts up from my groin. I fell out as soon as I could and could feel a bulge beside my groin. I described what I felt and was sent to the MO. MO said I had a hernia in my groin. Straightaway was sent to the hospital to get looked at.\n\nDoctor gave me MC and I missed my POP.

For one, it helps guys who come from a more privilege environment meet people they wouldn\u2019t otherwise meet and this allows for some appreciation of how less privileged people live. \n\nTo a degree, learning how to shoot a gun also requires one to be more mature as well.

Why? Because they didn\u2019t even win the World Cup, they merely got to the semis. Other players in other sports won national tournaments but were not granted any sort of exemptions. There are also players that play sports that do not have a World Cup equivalent. It\u2019s the reason why players like Ki and Son are not given exemption despite playing for Swansea\/Spurs. You have to win an olympics medal or win the Asian games etc to be granted exemption. \n\nBringing it back to this case, if Ben Davis got the deferment approved, I am extremely sure that other players in other sports will raise the concern about their deferment rights. Sure, they probably aren\u2019t playing at the Premier League level in their sports, but how do you define \u2018Premier League standard\u2019 in other sports? Will they get deferment if they are playing in for example, a league equivalent to the Swiss league in Football? Besides, in Football, FIFA comes out with a revised list ranking of each countries\u2019 top leagues, something that other sports might not have the luxury of. If I\u2019m playing for say, Nottingham forest in the championships, which is still by far at a much, much higher level than any current SG player, do I get any deferment rights? If not, why? I have still shown that I\u2019m quite probably the best player in the country by being selected by Forest. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitcan of ugly worms that would be opened if they grant deferment now, despite it being an issue that should have laws set in place a long time ago.

He studied at the Singapore Sports School from 2013 to 2015 before moving to London's Harrow High School last year. Ben\u2019s father, Harvey Davis, was originally from the UK. He is the founder of Singapore\u2019s private football academy, JSSL.\n\nAccording to FIFA rules, Ben qualifies to play for the following countries: Singapore (by citizenship), Thailand (by birth and heritage through his mother), England (by heritage through his father).\n\nBen has been playing for Singapore age groups since U14 levels. But Ben could have played for Thailand and England. This should speak for something. He could be playing for better and stronger countries but he is choosing Singapore.\n\nSo the least Singapore could do is defer his enlistment by at least 2 years so he could see out his football scholarship in Fulham. By the time he completes it, he would be about 19 or 20. This sounds like the enlistment age for many Singaporeans anyway. So what is MINDEF babbling about?\n\nBen is playing in Premier League South U18. That\u2019s the highest standard of English Football at that age level. There are players at this level that get promoted to their first teams. With Fulham regaining Premier League Football, he has a chance of playing in the Premier League next season. This may not be the Olympics. Nor will Fulham do a Leicester and win the Premier League. But to say he is not representing Singapore is wrong. Ben is Singaporean and he is flying our flag high in England. And if he makes it to the first team, that should be worth as much as an Olympic medal. The problem is that MINDEF is not contextualising his case. Football is not Swimming. It is a team sport and the Olympics is not the highest achievement in Football.

Effectively, it's a concession of the discriminatory nature of these legislation. It was thus disappointing then that the Govt's \"solution\" was to repeal one discriminatory legislation and to entrench another in the Constitution. LHL more or less said his Govt will be moving to entrench in the Constitution a piece of legislation so discriminatory that it risks being struck down by the Courts for running afoul of the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution. \n\nI can appreciate not wanting to make drastic changes but the Govt could have stopped at repeal of 377A and left the definition of marriage, which is currently already between a man and a woman, without entrenching it in the Constitution.\n\nEdit: All that said, the above depends on the actual language of the constitutional amendment.

While romantic relationships may differ from normal platonic relationships, communication is a common aspect.

You blame anything and everything around you but yourself. Maybe its because your face ugly or you're short that's why no girls are interested? Sorry that only applies to dating apps.

You make a lot of generalisations about women as a whole like saying girls aren\u2019t interested in something as if all girls have the same preference. as a woman, I assure you that not all women like ah bengs, and there is no one type of man that all women are attracted to. It\u2019s also a rare woman that has three or more men (I have no idea where you got that number from) chasing after her. \n\nYou need to work on your attitude towards women in general before you\u2019re ready to date in my opinion. It doesn\u2019t seem like you view women as individuals or even real people, just a goal to be attained. Your attitude towards dating seems superficial and too focused on getting a girlfriend rather than finding a girl you like and emotionally connect with. \n\nI suggest that you stop trying to date and focus on forming platonic friendships for now. When you befriend a woman, don\u2019t look at her as a woman before anything else, get to know her like you would another guy. Incel attitudes also tend to form because of self-worth issues, so maybe you should work on yourself as well before dating. try to build self confidence and self awareness, and think about what you want from a relationship, not how to get into one. if you can afford it, I also recommend trying therapy. It sounds like you weren\u2019t taught about healthy relationships growing up and this can probably help with that, along with your unhealthy views towards women.","You sounded like a nice guy r\/niceguys","Good on you to be able to self reflect on your mindset.

I understand that the economy important, and our livelihoods depend on it, but Singaporeans' well-being is as important if not more. \n\nEarlier in the year, we had the vaccines. The government encouraged us to take the vaccine. Above 80% of us did. And only then, the restrictions became harsher. It went back to 2 people despite most of us taking the vaccine. Then just recently, the government announced that WFH is no longer the default arrangement due to the reason that 'face-to-face interaction is important for team dynamics'. And yet they do not even allow social gatherings at workplaces. \n\nDon't you just get frustrated by this. We followed what the government says. And in return, we got this. Maybe, in the eyes of the government, money is more important than the well-being of Singaporeans.\n\nI'm sorry if this seemed like a rant, I'm just expressing my opinion on the government policies during this pandemic.","On the last point, I understand that during the peak of the wave when we had 3k cases each day and our healthcare system was coming under significant strain, the government didn\u2019t want to risk any further worsening so they kept all the safety measures around, even those that were quite stupid and\/or most likely barely made a difference (e.g. music in restaurants). There was no appetite to experiment then. However, now that cases are relatively low (Omicron aside), I hope some serious evaluation can finally happen on some of the safety measures that may no longer be very effective but when revoked make life so much better and bearable. We now have the breathing room to try out lifting some measures and seeing if there is a spike; if there is none (like how cases continued decreasing despite 5 pax), then they don\u2019t have much of an effect on the situation, and we can kiss them goodbye.\n\nFor example, outdoor masking (or at least in places like parks) would be one of them - there has to be a reason why so many countries are eager to lift mask mandates when they can (and indoor, not even outdoor), even including bastions of Covid-zero such as China and Australia. The face mask has become such a constant representation of the pandemic in Singapore, I can\u2019t wait to be able to walk outside without a mask on again and feel the wind on my (lower) face.\n\nI would\u2019ve also included restricted mall entry\/mandatory check-ins as one of the aforementioned measures to be considered, but since the government seems to be going the way of more and more vaccination-differentiation measures and entertaining thoughts of revoking vaccination status for those who don\u2019t take the booster, there\u2019s zero chance it\u2019s going away for at least the next half a year.","Wow, I really enjoyed the points you made on the effectiveness of our current safety measures. \n\nThe whole issue with safe entry gantries is definitely something to be sorted out asap if the government is planning to take a long-term approach. The shift to the use of automated gantries does not work at all during peak periods. I've seen multiple instances where the new gantries are completely disregarded and malls end up hiring temp staffs again to do the vaccination status screening at entrances.\n\nLikewise I don't think its an effective long-term solution to just hire these part-time workers to scan through droves of people on a daily basis, complacency quickly sets in. Especially considering the ease of faking your safe entry pass or vaccination status with a prepared screenshot for the unvaccinated to sneak their way in if they do desire to do so.\n\nI think we need to decide on how we are going to draw the line between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated in the future. The initial perks of entry and larger group sizes were essential back when the government was still promoting the public to get vaccinated. Now, however, with our current impasse of having a majority vaccinated population and a small group that is dead-set on not getting vaccinated, is it still wise to draw such a solid line between the 2 groups? I'd wager that people planning on going out in groups of 5s are already vaccinated anyways. And those who are stubborn about vaccination will undoubtedly find a way to exploit the situation if they desire to do so. \n\nWhat if we are to allow the public to have an honour system with regards to the safe-entry check in?\n\nThe way I see it, we aren't using safe-entry to conduct super-specific contact tracing anymore with our government's new approach and it being impossible to do so with the large number of cases allowed now.\n\nI don't see malls actively limiting people from entering nowadays and most malls are packed most days anyways.\n\nIf we were to just scrape "],"833":["Thank you for this informative thread","Had a friend who wanted to fly a drone at MBS area.

Riding in the next lane over is dangerous as vehicles change lanes across it frequently, and you get aggressive behaviour from drivers. The fact that the 1.5m passing gap is a \"guideline\" rather than a rule already tells you about the treatment cyclists get, and many times drivers leave even less than a metre because they're too impatient to change lanes and would rather endanger a life to save a few secs on their commute.","Exactly where should cyclists go?\n\nTruth is, there is very little room for cyclist in Singapore - the roads have absolutely no road shoulder so there's no real space for cyclists. And they're not really welcome on walking paths as well.\n\nThe one and only dedicated cycling lane is at one ulu corner of the island and is not exactly pleasant to ride on especially after rain.\n\nEither ban cycling on the road, or make space for it - both physically, and legally as well - make the 1.5m gap a rule.

You only have to look at peak hour Orchard Road (especially the weekend morning nightmare outside Paragon). It\u2019ll also affect PHVs and taxis, so ultimately his solution boils down to converting a significant number of motorists and commuters to buses, MRTs and bikes.

While we can all dream of a car-free future, it\u2019s likely not going to happen, and the overflow road traffic has to be managed.\n\nA more complete solution would need to account for both vehicular traffic and foot traffic. Simply put, when you convert stroads to streets there should be some conversion of stroads to roads or even streets to roads nearby to manage the overflow.

You just have to answer the following two questions and perform accordingly:\n\nWhat does my boss need to justify to their bosses in order to secure a promotion for me?\n\nWhat can i do to make the above easier for my boss?","Hard work is a basic prerequisite. It's like guys complaining about how girls are not into them even though they are \"nice guys\".\n\nWhat's more important is the visibility and impact of the hard work.\n\ne.g. Person A OTs every day but just completes their assigned tasks.\n\nPerson B doesn't OT at all but has made process improvements that saved 20 hours every month **and presented it to management so they are aware of it**.\n\nPerson B is more likely to be promoted.","Hardworking by itself is never a metric for promotion. If you\u2019re incompetent and hardworking, you\u2019ll do more harm than someone who\u2019s incompetent and lazy. \n\nPeople always mistake being hardworking and being capable. Being exceptionally capable is what gets you promoted. Being hardworking just allows you to keep doing whatever you\u2019re doing.","It\u2019s the same with products. An average product but great marketing sells more than an excellent product with average marketing.","This is true generally everywhere. You want to be BOTH capable of producing results AND earning your employer\u2019s trust. That trust is precious, and can be earned in many ways. Me liking you because you know how to do small talk IS a skill and IS contributing to that trust. Think about it, let\u2019s say I am the boss, if I want to promote a manager to manage my employees, would I promote someone who can\u2019t even communicate well with me? It\u2019ll be so painful giving instructions and discussing my company\u2019s affair with someone who isn\u2019t good at social skills, and how can I trust him to manage my employees well? Him being able to communicate well with me IS a skill and IS a sign of great competence.\n\nAnyone of sufficient seniority will have to manage people more junior; teach them, lead them, guide them, and coordinate their work.

Soft skill = skill.\n\nAnd in general, if someone has to work very hard to keep up with the standard, maybe outperform slightly, that means that the person may not be able to cope with the next rung of responsibilities. Someone who is \u201ca natural\u201d and can perform their tasks very efficiently and learn quickly may be a better candidate for promotion. Depends on field and roles though. In some places, someone who shows potential will be challenged and stress-tested with higher responsibilities (i.e. given opportunities), forcing them to work hard, so that the smart but chill ones don\u2019t get promoted.","After many years of working, I've come to internalize that hard work and efficiency often gets rewarded with more work. That's not to say that hard work and being good at what you do isn't important. But in order to move upwards, a open and honest relationship with your supervisor, which enables career planning is also very important. The concept of heads down busting your gut and hoping that someone up there will take notice is not practical in today's society. Then of course there are jerks of supervisors who exploit the hard working grinders and reward the cronies. Finding the right boss\/organization to work for is also so so important.","Singaporeans need to tear themselves away from the student mentality of just \u201cgetting good grades\u201d. \nIf you just gonna be an obedient worker drone that executes tasks unquestioningly without thinking bigger and being able to talk to more senior folks, your career will stagnate at a very junior level.","Why promote a capable worker into a poor leader? The requirements for a higher leadership role are very different from that of a ground worker. Let the good ground worker be remunerated by other means (PB, incentive trips, or becoming a technical lead in the case of STEM). Neither torture him nor shortchange the company by promoting him into a higher role if said person is not cut out to be a leader.","A lot of people tend to miss very basic logic. First understand, if you get promoted, what are the roles and responsibilities of that new position, sync that in to your mind and convince your bosses that you are capable of handling that new job, if you are just good at current job then you will be seen as a person for current job not the next one.","Typically as you go up in corporate ladder communications becomes more valuable. First level of value is execution, Second level is unity and third is communication. It also means if u are only good a talking but poor at unifying your resources or people, poor result from execution is not going to keep you at high position","Here's the truth. Producing results is your primary job. You don't get promoted for doing your job. Hard work just gets you more work. You might get a raise though.\n\n\nPeople promote those they like. Why should anyone promote or advance someone they dislike.\n\n\n\"Yes Men\" get promoted. Your job isn't to take initiative. Your job is to do what you're told do. Initiative is defined as doing what your boss wants you to do without having to tell you. If you want to do your own ideas, then you be the boss first.\n\n\nFinally, \"assholes\" get promoted. When you get to a higher level, you have to do more approvals and rejections. If you don't know how to say no or decline people, then you have no value. Anybody can say yes. We need people who can say, \"sorry, Tan Ah Kow is not ready for promotion\", even if they are ready and even if the company has the budget.\n\n\nSo ask yourself, do you want to suck up?

It's impossible to move on while you're still talking and interacting with your ex. Try to settle the wedding issues ASAP, then cut off communication with him. \n\nTherapy is a good choice.

Maybe I can share just how much I can relate to this. 3 months ago, my partner of 6 years broke it off with me, I felt completely blindsided, my future and plans with them went up in smoke. I haven't had a good night's sleep since 5 months ago, when my partner first brought up the problem that they had fallen out of love with me.  \n\n\nFirstly, I would advise you to work on self-love. Recognise your own self-worth. Speak to your friends. Your true friends will always be there for you. Don't feel bad for needing to approach your friends. I personally went and cried my eyes out to a few close friends for the first month or so. A true friend will not abandon you at this time when you truly need a pillar of emotional support, even if it is just their presence. My experience is that no one will ever be able to understand you, because each relationship is unique, and it is your own.   \n\n\nSecondly, take your time to grieve. Don't give yourself any time restraint e.g. I need to be able to function as per normal in 1 month, 3 months, 1 year... the only way to get through loss is to grieve and feel all the pain. Don't suppress it, let yourself feel it, because to love is allow yourself to be vulnerable to feel the pain of heartbreak. But always remember, that what is meant for you, will never leave you. I would advice you to not think that you have lost 'the one' for you. Because I personally believe the love of your life would never leave you.   \n\n\nWhat worked the best for me, is to keep living, day by day. Be patient with yourself. Set daily goals, work through them. Even if you can't start by something small! Like a 5 min walk just to get yourself out of the house.

Since it's a really long time, have you guys considered going for couples therapy to see if there is a way to meet in the middle regarding differences in values? It's okay to call the wedding off first, but considering the relationship is almost half your life and probably the amount of time you put into it, I do think there is some value in talking it out properly rather than through a bottled up release.

After they brought in an angmoh company (Tower Transit) and painted the buses green, basic salary shot up to 1.9k in 2016, and increased till today, they are paying more than 2k in basic for first-time bus captains. \n\nAnd then they also introduced free travel passes, so now all bus captains get free unlimited travel on buses and MRT. This can save a lot in terms of travel expenses. \n\nAnd now there's also clearer career pathways, like you can work towards higher ranks, or explore other tracks within the industry. Before 2016, such opportunities were very rare. \n\nUnder the current tendering system where operators may change every few years, they also have rules in place to make sure that in the event of a change of operator, bus captains can choose to stay with their current company or transfer to new company, and both sides will actually offer pay raises in order to retain or attract them.

I once attended HOGC and was an active member there from 2014-2016 (when they were in the process of moving to a new facility to host their services) my 2.5yrs with HOGC was a depressing one. Initially, things were great, the people were nice and friendly and included me in many activities. i didn\u2019t have a large social circle back then so being accepted by the people from HOGC felt nice and validated me. However after 6months, there was this constant pressure from the leaders. There was this unspoken but rather intensively implied need to bring our friends to HOGC regardless of their faith. Their messages strongly emphasise that the church values are always right and we have a spiritual duty to reach out to the people out there. Needless to say, this was a very toxic mindset and i lost a couple of friends outside church. I was upset about it but the friends in church always said things like its their loss and we know better than them, giving rise to this false impression that we are the \u201crole models of Christ\u201d thankfully, as i entered tertiary education, i began to meet new people and i came to realise the misguided mindset HOGC was preaching. Soon after, i made my decision to leave the church. I have nothing against Christianity, this is just from my 2.5yrs of experience with HOGC.

I don't know if it's changed, but it was a disturbing experience:\n\n1. During the H1N1 outbreak, I had mild symptoms and was told to stay at home (away from school, etc). I informed the friend who had brought me to HOGC and... 2 people from the church showed up at my doorstep unannounced, and would not go away. They insisted on being let in. I was wearing a mask and baking. When they finally agreed to leave, they wanted to take some of my baked goods for their pastors. I did not offer them any, but their glorification of their pastors was such.\n2. I had another friend who had been in HOGC. When she left, she told me how in every cell group, the leaders were asked to collate data - opinions, information, etc - and report everything upwards. This friend was a bit less susceptible to their bullshit, so she left after her cell leader tried to forbid her from hanging out with non-HOGC friends, and when they demanded to know where she was hanging out with her friends and crashing those social occasions (sensing a familiar theme?)\n3. The final straw for me was when one of their sermons involved an overseas guest pastor, who told an (admittedly moving at that time) story of how a Christian youth group on a sinking ferry had given up their life vests to other passengers because \"they knew they were going to heaven\". Right after that, he had everyone close their eyes and bask in the emotional swirl elicited by that story and started ringing a bell. He announced that *his* church had spent something like US$3,000 to buy that stupid bell (which he was ringing) from the ferry that had sunk. US. Three.

My initial impressions was that the people them was quite friendly but were too obsessed. \n\nDuring services they would just interject with, \"yes\", \"amen\", e.t.c all at once like some kind of hive mind. That creeped me out. My CG didn't really pressure me to tithe (we were all broke students, leader included) but I  was disturbed by one church testimony of a guy who skipped meals and took other jobs to contribute to the church building fund (think it was the new lounge below the Imaginarium). I felt that that was unhealthy and leadership really shouldn't have platformed such extremes. Other stuff like my churchmate's Instagram, which was basically all free church advertising creeped me out. Those were most of the red flags but I didn't really act on them until some other stuff that occurred.\n\nI came to learn about HOGC's ties to CHC and also came across an interview by Pastor How about his, quite successful, attempts to circumvent MOE restrictions on church based evangelism in schools by pressuring existing student members to invite classmates over. Simultaneously, I started reading the Bible chronologically, from Genesis onwards. The stuff in there didn't sit well with me so I brought all of the above issues up with my CG leaders. Their response was not helpful in assuaging my doubts and concerns. \n\nFrom then on, everything went downhill. I left HOGC and eventually Christianity altogether.

Slowly I just started to build up more and more disagreements with the church in my head, until I decided enough was enough, wrote a long email with verses from the Bible telling them exactly where I disagreed with them (this was excluding the money stuff because that was actually the least of my concerns at that time - was giving like $30 a month or something). I had to find it in myself to make the tough decision and in a sense it was me against everyone else. But I'm so glad I did it.","Here Oso Got Cult","You know why 377A still not repealed?

They are pressured to bring new friends every week, special events and stuff are always organised for mass appeal rather than focusing on the faith. Passion dies very fast but faith doesn't, with the way they conduct things I am not surprised they have a high turnover rate which result in a very young church population. And as much as they like to have new believers, there is a total lack of effort in retaining people that want to leave which was the huge red flag for me. \n\nWould I say they are a cult? From what I've seen thus far, not really, they don't really preach about the prosperity gospel and stuff.

For example, at one of the more recent ones involving the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, hosted by then-MP Yaacob Ibrahim (so glad he has retired and was never a minister, good riddance...) they ended up focusing more on making cyclists wear PPE, prohibited handlebars wider than 700mm on footpaths. They completely omitted usage patterns of cyclists, pedestrians, motorists and of course infrastructure. Basically they gave a set of advisories to the Government that puts the onus only on cyclists to manage their behaviors and equipment, without touching anything on policy and infrastructure. It was odd that they never listened to the cyclists that participated in the panel, and gave more weight to the cycling shop owners instead.\n\nBut oh well, it's not all bad.

I agree with this because I have seen ridiculous things pre-covid, i.e. length of more than 30 bicycles. That's like the length of 2, maybe 3 buses.

No. Why?

Their metro system is arguably better than ours.","I found many people unable to accept why Hong Kong is number 1: \n\nLet me give my hot take given that I take both cities\u2019 public transport regularly.\n\nBUSES:\n- HK\u2019s bus companies are incredibly competitive, most bus services would have at least one or two variation. For eg. 86x 86k etc. they would intersect one another\u2019s route but connect different estafes but through a shared common path. Another eg. 682, then 682A 682B. Those two others are only offered during peak hours and they do some additional stops to pick up people in less common estates. \n- Their buses are mostly point to point and very efficient. For a comparison, imagine a bus leaving orchard road area and the next stop goes straight to Bedok or Tampines area, our SG rep for this bus is bus 23. But in HK it\u2019s almost every bus that plows Nathan Road (their main \u201corchard road\u201d) \n\nMRT:\n- In this area, we are pretty close in terms of quality\n- However, our train interchanges design are not well thought of, you can imagine most of their lime transfers are just like our city hall \/ raffles city kind, just crossing the platform is a change of line. Usually to implement this you need to use two stops on a parallel line overlapping in two stops (which we lack space and density to perform this feat except the old two lines)\n- Their frequency at peak hours is sometimes less than a min, that\u2019s how insanely efficient it is. \n\nTAXIS:\n- HK taxis are notoriously shit, however you have to give it to them for their old housing estate planners, their transport hub in each estate would contain: taxi stands, minibus stands, and bus stands. (Yes stands only not much seats found)\n- SG does them in malls but not everyone live near malls and despite our density our estates are quite sparsely spread that this model doesn\u2019t work for us \n\nThe last piece of the puzzle:\nMINIBUSES\n- this is a natural occurring last-mile problem solver created by the free markets. It appeared due to public bus drivers going on strike and they appeared t","Train fault at NEL now...","How is HK 1 lol?? Public transport here sucks","Japanese rail network is very impressive for its size and extensive reach throughout Tokyo. Their consistency with being punctual must also be acknowledged. But I think it is rather fair that Tokyo itself is lower than Sg based on my personal experience, not that it means anything.\n\nWe sometimes see rush hour crowds at MRT stations making the news, but it's very common for them in Tokyo. The trains can arrive on time but the crowd will still be there because there's a limit to how many trains can hold. Too many lines sharing the same rail probably makes it difficult for them to throw in more trains to support the large population too. And while buses are punctual too, they come in low intervals. Travelling around Tokyo takes planning to be efficient. Travelling around Singapore is conveniently efficient (aside from train breakdowns, but even then buses are quite convenient). Quality > quantity alone is not enough. The Japanese are definitely doing very well in terms of quality though. Good service from staff too, they really love their mic and speaker announcements haha.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, their train stations and underground subway network is impressively large. But they're not the most accessible and friendly. Lots of stairs and not enough elevators and escalators. If we consider the elderly, the mobility-impaired personnel within our society, it can be difficult for them to traverse through the subways. I see some lift assists for wheelchairs but they're mainly in the metropolitan downtown part of Tokyo. Around the outskirts and further from the center you will see less of such support available. Take for example Shin-Nihombashi Station still within central Tokyo. There are escalators within the station itself, but not on any of the street access exits, and also no elevators available. There are also no wheelchair lift assists that I could see at the exits either. \n\nCouple other minor points to add.\n1) Transport costs.

But they will still be required on public transport, where people are in prolonged close contact in a crowded space; and in healthcare settings such as clinics, hospitals, and residential and nursing homes, where there are vulnerable persons, PM Lee said.\n\n> For schools in particular, masks should not be needed in class, he said.\n\n> He acknowledged that parents may be worried, but assured them that the Government has assessed that relaxing mask requirements in schools would be safe.\n\n> \u201cChildren do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other,\u201d said PM Lee.\n\n> \u201cYou have to learn to read faces... if (a person) is angry or happy... otherwise, you grow up with a blank space in your brain,\u201d he said.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for learning and development.\u201d\n\n> Experts in Singapore had suggested recently that there was no need to continue enforcing mandatory mask-wearing indoors, since over 90 per cent of the population has been vaccinated and over half the population has been infected with the virus.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https:\/\/github.com\/fterh\/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https:\/\/github.com\/fterh\/sneakpeek)","Think I would still wear it till the end of the year.

The helicopter was en route to Abu Bakar naval base.\n\nAnd I quote the DG\n> Terdahulu saya menerima taklimat daripada Kepten Shaiful Fadhli bin Ismail, Pegawai Memerintah KD Sultan Ismail berhubung kawasan keselamatan Op Benteng Laut Sektor 8 di bawah Kawasan Tanggungjawab (KTJ) pihak yang berkenaan sebelum menaiki penerbangan menggunakan helikopter PDRM ke ABMB di Batuan Tengah.\n\nWhich loosely translates to \"I (the newly appointed DG of Malaysia's Security Council) was being briefed by an officer with regards to the security of the area before boarding the helicopter\".\n\nIn addition, usually in most countries, when you're ferrying or escorting VVIPs and it's a planned event, the security details would usually plan ahead of time the best route very carefully. But of course there can be exceptions.","Let me just share a bit of my insights on this incidents...\n\n1) Intruding SG airspace on Sept 11 is probably the worst mistake you can ever do. Regardless of whether it's a mistake or not. Last time I check, if a pilot makes an error, lives are at stake. So I don't really buy it. And like what some people said, if he cannot even just following the border lines, properly, with or without equipment. He shouldn't be a pilot. SG could have literally use SAM and shoot the helicopter down, instead of sending F16s. Do you really wanna know why we didn't? Or it's just a pure ignorance? We sent F16s because our command didn't want to unnecessarily start a war. That's why we didn't. We always acted with restraint.\n\n\n2) Our past history with Malaysia has been nasty. Look when Msia decides to launch military exercise in 1991. Or when Msia threatens to cut off our water line if we didn't do your bidding. Or when Msia decides to park their vessels in Tuas? All these are an act of aggression. And like what you have pointed out. Past history does not mean that you guys have the intention to conduct acts of aggression. Really? You truly believe in it? I cannot change your views about it. But think of it as a perspective of us Singaporeans. Nobody likes aggression. We only acted appropriate to it.\n\n\n- When Msia threatened to cut water, if I didn't remember wrongly, LKY mentioned that he would consider it as an act of aggression, and would attack. Look at SAF slogan. \n\n- When Msia launched exercise in 1991. Close to 500k SG guys were activated during National Day as a precaution.\n\n- When Msia ships intruded our seas in Tuas, we sent out naval ships as a way to show force. You know that we could have easily destroy all these ships right?\n\n\nMany of times SG acted more appropriately than our so called \"Big brother\". Msia cannot even get a grip of themselves man.\n\n\n*Do you know why our Government and your government has way friendlier relationship when Najib was in charge? Go and do a lit","It's most definitely a mistake, but it speaks of basic blatant disrespect for singapore. Such a basic error should not be made by someone with a pilots license, particularly someone from a professional organisation such as the police. \n\nThis isnt the first time, or the last time, when malaysian vessels or aircraft have deliberately or mistakenly entered into singapore terriotory. Having a malaysian helicopter fly over a singapore military base is NO LAUGHING MATTER. There comes a point where you got to ask yourself, wtf is malaysia doing? \n\nBy contrast, sg makes a VERY SERIOUS effort to not intrude into malaysian airspace. The takeoff and landing of jets from tengah is extremely tight for pilots. We dont make excuses, or 'oops!' \n\nI'll give you an analogy. You have a neighbour with a dog who likes to shit everywhere. One day, he shits on your doorstep and makes a mess, and you complain. He apologises, tells you not to be so uptight. You let it pass. Mistakes happen, a dog is a dog. \n\nHowever, what happens when this happens not the second, but the third, fourth fifth time? Is your neighbour just being ignorant, or does he have ill intent out for you?","Accident or not, it was still a potential threat that SG needed to deal with. RSAF did well and protected SG sovereignty swiftly.\n\nMy question is, given the Army exercise video last month \"*punch through directly into the heart of the enemy\"*, which arguably could or could not have been intentional as well - what is MY's intention?","Their boats used to enter our waters frequently under the disguise of a \u2018mistake\u2019.

Fine, but the matter of the fact is, it happened.\n\nI think OP does not understand international politics. For any incident like this, it also as much about how the offending nation recognises the act of intrusion. This is key -  the recognising the act of intrusion also recognises the sovereignty of the intruded state. \n\nThis is how grown up countries do it:\n> On 3 March 2007, a company of 171 Swiss soldiers mistakenly entered Liechtenstein, as they were disorientated and took a wrong turn due to bad weather conditions. The troops returned to Swiss territory after they had travelled more than 2 km into the country. The Liechtenstein authorities did not discover the incursion and were informed by the Swiss after the incident. The incident was disregarded by both sides. A Liechtenstein spokesman said, \"It's not like they invaded with attack helicopters. No problem, these things happen\"\n\nThis is how malaysia does it:\n> Throughout the official assignment that has taken place until now, PDRM did not receive any notification from Singapore\u2019s aviation authorities about any incident of a helicopter flight entering their airspace\u201d","A radar warning receiver identifies targeting by a fire control radar. It is not practicable to install warning receiver that detects search radar, because detecting the low energy emission of a search radar will mean picking up a lot of radar clutter, nor would it be practical because almost every country in the world owns military search radar. A fire control radar, on the contrary, emits a high power, narrow radar beam at high energy to acquire sufficient information to hit a target, and is therefore practicable to detect via radar warning receiver.\n\nFire control radar lock is not routinely used because it is considered a deeply hostile act under international norms. It is an internationally accepted norm to warn off the intruder via radio contact before escalating to other measures, including fighter escort or ground-based instruction to land at a designated landing area. Radar lock is very high up on the ladder of response.","Well, if I can explain the reaction accurately, it's the action that counts, not the intention behind it - because that's the politics of your country.\n\nThough, that also brings about the point that as of recently, political changes in your country have created a less-than-friendlier-than-usual climate between us. \n\nOn Reddit here, we've had a few provocative posts from your end telling us that our military \"have cool toys and none of the expertise\", and the other one, I forgot what it was about, but it was weird. Though dude had a history of making polls about trying to kill \"Chinese Commies\". Posts have since been removed.\n\nThat, and every year, on our national day, the Malaysian military carries out live firing exercises around the border, and they took the cake this year by releasing a very obviously provocative video.\n\nThat particular Ex-PM of yours has had a long, strong history of blaming a lot of things on us as well, or at least, that's what we see from our media.\n\nSo cumulatively, it is easy to look at the action as something hostile and politically-motivated. \n\nThe problem comes in that if we actually blew up the copter for entering our airspace, the narrative will shift towards us blowing up a Malaysian helicopter, carrying a VIP on board. The intention, details then won't matter to the masses. \n\nThis incident and the responses it invoked, that despite the fact, as you pointed out, that the route was commonly used, people still reacted the way they did, is evidence of that.\n\nTake a step back, and this can be used against us - that simply because the other party doesn't have the necessary equipment to defend themselves, they are allowed to fly over our military facilities, and we can't do anything because of possible backlash. \n\nWe as a separate country cannot be too careless with our defenses, because it only takes one incident to topple it all off. So every \"mistake\" actually counts to us.\n\nThough, saying all that, it's just your politicians, and the pe","Hi, I\u2019m a former GBAD (Ground Based Air Defence) officer who served in Singapore\u2019s 24\/7 air defence duties. Usually when we have unidentified\/unauthorized aircraft coming into Singapore airspace, we are required to upgrade our alert state and be ready for firing. There was once a personal aircraft that deviated from its flight path and we were on the highest alert (we unlocked the button to shoot it down) but we got in contact with the pilot.\n\nContrary to public opinion, this actually happens really often, especially around National day. There are always police helicopters from Malaysia coming near us and sometimes planes. There was one night we had to upgrade 5 times.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m inclined to believe this was a mistake because of the initial flight path and this pilot alerted the fighter jets instead of the usual air defence upgrade. It probably wasn\u2019t their usual show of force. Nonetheless, same shit different day.","I can understand why Singapore's airspace is tightly guarded  n monitored given it's very limited size which renders her with a shorter time frame to react if needed to neutralize any threats in the event of hostile acts. \n\nSeeing this is the case, it would be prudent to establish clear communication channels with our neighbors such that any future harmless incidents can be established accordingly so as to avoid any unintended reactions from all sides.","Point 3. All the pilot had to was to follow the coastline on the Malaysian side VISUALLY and not go over the straits between Johor and Tekong. If the pilot cannot do that, well, maybe they shouldn't be a pilot.","Agreed with your analysis, the thing is many Singaporeans have the NDP saga Pukul Habis 2.0 at the back of their head, so I\u2019m not surprised that there would be a big reaction on our side in terms of suggesting potential malice","Chill la don't need to come here just to tell us this.

And my income is mid 6 figs. \n\nHis response was that he wished he was in my shoes because as a rich kid, his achievements are never his own. It\u2019s difficult to find meaning when everything is handed to you on a platter, when your life trajectory is to just stay the course for what your ancestors built. If you do well, it\u2019s expected and it\u2019s not your credit.

His health only got worse because we couldn't afford the surgery or the medications he needed. I had to essentially work to keep my dad alive and help my siblings with the finances. We were able to save up what we needed with my first month salary for that surgery. But it was too late, and he unexpectedly passed away just a few days before he was scheduled for his appointment. And he passed away where I worked (I'm a healthcare worker). It was agonising. I will never forget that crushing defeat I felt.

No one ever wants to face hardships. And it's incidents like these that makes me bitter. That extravagant handbag she carries could have paid for my father's surgery. If we were rich, he could have lived longer. If we were rich, we would never need to sacrifice our own happiness for a chance at simply surviving life. If we were rich, I wouldn't have had severe body issues due to starving now and then when I was younger. If we were rich, I would never have faced any of these adversities.

I said, \u2018I\u2019m not having this sitting next to us the whole trip.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe couple requested a seat change but the cabin crew informed them that the only seats available were at the back of economy class.\n\nUnwilling to downgrade, they decided to stay put. But midway through the flight, they claimed the dog\u2019s presence became unbearable.\n\nAside from the snorting, it was also farting, they said. The dog was also eating into Mr Press\u2019 legroom, with its head shoved under his feet and saliva dribbling on his leg, Mrs Press said.\n\n\u201c(The owner) couldn\u2019t have the dog out in the aisle because they couldn\u2019t get the trolleys through, so it had to come in farther, which meant his head was under my husband\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cMy husband was in shorts, and was getting the dog\u2019s saliva goo on his leg,\u201d she told Stuff.\n\nUpon another request to change seats, the flight attendants moved the couple to seats at the front of the economy cabin, which had been reserved for staff.\n\nBefore landing, the flight attendants told them that an incident report had been filed and that SIA would be in contact with them.\n\nBut after a week passed with no news, Mrs Press e-mailed her complaints to the airline.\n\nTwo weeks later, the airline responded, offering them gift vouchers worth $200 to use on the KrisShop","What if the person next to the dog is allergic to dogs? Like deathly allergic? I would be fucking irritated also because of the saliva and the farting.

Then with everything so expensive, your pay is barely enough. I know so many people living paycheck to paycheck.
