They gain access into these wards by a small cut out window that I found at the top of the ceiling. It follows corridors in the hospital and can be found in almost every corridor. In 2008, I got my first experience seeing this and my mother told me it was used to transport hospital documents. In 2011 however, the boxes or trains as I called it , were removed but the track remained . Latest in 2020, the only remnants of this system were the small cutout window boxes at the top of the ceiling . It was sealed shut. This has been bugging me since I was little. I always wondered what the true purpose of these small trains were and what their true names were? So anyone who has worked in these old Singaporean hospitals or used to do maintaince on these things , what are these small weird things that I am thinking of and what is their true purpose. Maybe I'm a little off about it or maybe it doesn't exist ? Can someone tell me .",,Pneumatic tube system used to transport documents in Singaporean hospitals,information/news,other,other

My other complaints:

1) they have made it so much harder to get Grab points and instead “randomly” assign points after every transaction. Sometimes you can get zero points. WTF. 

2) Grab driver accepts job and then went MIA , and we have to cancel after waiting for 15-20 mins. Prices went up in the meanwhile and still have to suck it up. 

3) Customer service provided zero service. Robotic responses and sometimes, I question if it’s a bot or it’s a real person answering my questions/feedback. Don’t expect any service recovery. 

Somehow they are buying over TransCab, which means they are increasing their market power. By doing so, they will exercise their power and grab more $$$ from me and you.

97,128plry,A food delivery guy on an e-bike almost hit my baby in her stroller today.,"I suppose this is more of a rant than a discussion. I want to clarify that this took place at an off-peak hour (12pm on a Saturday) on a pedestrian path where e-bikes are banned. There was a scaffolding that blocked the T-path that I was approaching, and my spidey-senses told me to check before pushing the stroller out. Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out “sorry sorry” as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number. He told me he seemed apologetic and he let him go, where the rider then dismounted and pushed his e-bike until out of our sight.

This is where the struggle comes in: because there was no hit / damage, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t report him as I don’t know what platform he works for. I can’t get the police involved as there is no license tied to his vehicle, despite a legal ban that was laid out to prevent exactly such incidents. 

I am not against riders - I deeply respect that they are out there to make their livelihoods, but is your delivery more important the safety of my child, or your own safety? Is the near-miss not enough for you to feel to need to slow down and check if we are okay? Are you going to blatantly ignore this incident and cause a bigger, more painful lesson for someone else or for yourself?

Should we have collided, your “sorry” will not un-scar my 9 month old, or me. Your biggest issue would not be a missed delivery, and both your day and mine would have turned out very differently. You’re still out there making deliveries because I hesitated to push my baby’s stroller out onto the pedestrian path that I had every right to access on a Saturday afternoon. I don’t know what else I can do but to share this incident for more awareness towards pedestrians and riders alike to not take our road safety for granted.

Well, it seems that the people at LTA/SMRT have taken notice of my post, as I was told by a few other train otakus yesterday that the estimated travel timings on the platform line maps at Woodlands North & Woodlands stations have been increased, and are now close to what I have recorded previously.

So I went to check the platform line maps of all TEL stations, and all of them have been updated as of 9 December, 6.30pm.

With the updated line maps, they now show your estimated travel timings more accurately than the previous maps. This is evident when the cumulative travel times of all TEL stations from Woodlands North now have less than a minute deviation from my actual recorded timings, as shown in the updated table below.

Since its opening, I have been taking the entire TEL up and down frequently, and have made some observations about the line.

**1. How accurate are the travel times on platform line maps along the TEL?**

Although the distance between two consecutive stations along the TEL is shorter in the city area, I still find it odd that it only takes 1 min to travel between most of them, especially when including the time that the trains dwell at the stations. For reference, I will embed the links to the platform line maps here:  
[Woodlands North towards Gardens by the Bay](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QZ6j9nK7A6EvAUVaA)  
[Gardens by the Bay towards Woodlands North](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f6Hw1YP95isdTPc77)

I used the stopwatch on my phone to time the duration that the train takes to travel from one station to another and indeed, the actual duration is significantly larger than what is stated on the platform line maps, as stated in the tables below.

When I recorded the data, all travel timings between two consecutive stations and dwell times at stations were taken at least 3 times each to ensure consistency and averaged. All timings were recorded outside of weekday peak hours, so I am not sure whether these timings will increase during weekday peak hours.

To avoid making the post too long, I will post the travel and dwell times for individual stations separately in [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LO1lB0jptt8UJnlUYUd3KxYqSmKoyvIauf6DNYVlb5w/edit?usp=sharing) for those who are interested.

140,13ga0fg,Is there something amiss with the Jurong Region MRT plans?,"I am usually a great admirer of Singapore’s urban planning and public transportation system. However, when I look at the plans for the upcoming Jurong Region Line, I can’t help thinking that there are major issues which don’t seem to be fully considered by LTA:

https://landtransportguru.net/jrl-alignment-map/

Let’s first consider some facts:
- The upcoming Tengah state, as well as the ongoing expansion of Jurong state, will massively increase the population of the West (I would guess 50%)
- The East-West line is already completely packed
- Jurong East is already Singapore’s most overcrowded and chaotic station. Not just because of the number of people, but also because it’s quite old with narrow platforms that can’t barely fit the commuters using the station
- East is planned to have 4 lines to outside the region, including 3 that go directly to the CBD. West has only 1

However, instead of creating an alternative route to the CBD, Science Park and other business centers, the JR line will essentially route everyone in the West to Jurong East. Even to take the Cross Island line you need to go to Jurong East and then change again at Clementi. The JR line connects to Chua Chu Kang, but I don’t think it’s useful as you need to transverse the whole Bukit Panjang LRT to transfer to Downtown Line. So you have no choice but to transfer from red line to green line via… Jurong East.

I know that the government planned to create a new CBD in Jurong area, but now that seems unlikely with the HSR cancellation. And even if it will eventually happen, there is no way the 100s of thousands of people who will soon be living in Tengah and Jurong will be all working in the West.

I am missing something? Does LTA has some secret plan to prevent the collapse of green line and especially Jurong East station? (I dunno, some new train technology that will allow 15 second train intervals or so?)",,"Concerns about overcrowding on Jurong Region Line, lack of alternative routes to CBD",complaint,train service,train service
143,6lq9km,I wouldn't mind COE if I had reliable public transportation. But I don't. [SMRT Red Line Rant],"The red line is already sluggish and stuttery as it is. 

I used to be pissed off at how it's always slow, always stopping midway for no absolute god damn reason. But I've gotten used to it hence which is why I plan my journeys to and from my Polytechnic 20mins early nowadays. 

But no on many god damn situations 20mins isn't enough to compensate for the absolute gobshite that is the Red Line. Such as today. 

# 30 MINUTES DELAY? I'VE BEEN STANDING ON MY FUCKING LEGS ON THIS FUCKING PLATFORM FOR THE LAST FUCKING 45 MINUTES.

Either do two things Singapore, improve one of your main railway lines or end the COE program so that all of us can get the reliable transportation we need. 

-----

Now onto SMRT.

Seriously, who is the absolute cunt that's operating SMRT? 

 WHAT IS THE POINT OF NEW SHINY TRAINS IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN THEM ON AN UNRELIABLE SYSTEM?

New trains, new this, new that, waste millions of our dollars on nothing. The old refurbished trains do their job well. Why aren't you making train services reliable? I can't give an absolute shit about those new trains.

It's like putting bling on your rusty truck that's going to die. It's not going to extend its lifespan or improve it.

-----

Anyways back to my main point, I'm annoyed that in Singapore you can't have reliable transportation especially if you live along the red line. I wished I could get $3000 used cars without paying COE like what my Australian cousins are doing.

> Before you tell me to fuck off to Australia, I still have not served my NS. So yeah, I would be a fugitive if I were to migrate over now and not return back. I wouldn't have money in the first place to migrate anyways.

**EDIT**

I guess I have worded my rant a little wrongly, *what I was having in mind by my phrase ""Either abolish COE or improve public transportation"" was that the LTA-SMRT would force themselves to improve the trains because abolishing CEO will never be a sensible solution.*",,"Red Line train delays cause frustration, suggesting improved public transportation or end of COE program.",complaint,train service,policy/regulation

146,o66y97,Mini-LPT: Understand public transport transfer rules to save abit of money,"**Credits: https://landtransportguru.net/distance-based-fares/ You can read about this in more detail there.**

Our buses and trains currently operate using distance-based fares, based on what is shown [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/img/map/bus/fare-table.pdf).

You’ll notice that the fares don’t actually start at $0.00; for example, an adult starting his trip will incur a $0.92 “starting fare” just by tapping in.

However, most trips consist of more than 1 bus/train ride. As such, LTA laid out a few rules for transfers between rides; by following these rules, the next bus/train ride can be considered a continuation of the trip, with the total distance added up for the final fare. If the rules are broken, the tap-in will be considered a new trip, hence re-incurring the starting fare.

The transfer rules are as follows:
1) *A total of 5 transfers can be made in a single trip. Each transfer (i.e. the time between a tap-out and the next tap-in) must be within 45 minutes.* This gives a total of 6 separate bus/train rides per trip. However, this does not apply to transfers between train stations (see point 4).

2) *The time between the first and last tap-in must be less than 2 hours.* The time of the last tap-out doesn’t matter.

3) *The same bus service number cannot be taken consecutively.* However, it **can** be taken non-consecutively e.g. with a ride on a train or even on another bus service in between.

4) *Transfers directly between different train stations are allowed, but must be made within 15 minutes.*

5) *No tapping out and in at the same train station*. The only exceptions are at stations with unpaid links between lines (e.g. Tampines, Newton); for these cases, the transfer must be made within 15 minutes.

So, by keeping within the rules, we can try to keep within a single trip, such as when we are doing short trips for quick errands. This allows us to incur the starting fare only once.

152,2lbyrx,"Its not about you, its about them (or, how I learnt to hate the Singapore taxi system)","In Melbourne, where I am from, it is an offence for a taxi driver to cherry-pick fares. Here in Singapore, it seems an acceptable practice.

Lines and lines of taxi drivers last Friday night kept passing. Forty five minutes, and I counted (guestimated) 55 cabs that slowed down, asked where we were going, and then sped off. Finally, we had to resort to bribery ""we will give you extra money if you take us, please, no one is stopping"",a nd only then did he do it grudlgingly, and he was apparently going the same way as us as wel!! (He was going to Pasir Ris, we were going to Geylang - its on the fxn way, in the same direction, dude!)

Begging the whole ""Change of shift, must get home to family""  - and ""not going that way"" or just simply speeding away when the fare isnt to their liking is bullshit - oh sorry, not going *your* way? huh? Im not a freakin hitchhiker trying to bum a lift, Im going to pay you for your damn service. 

Nowhere in Singapore is far away. Nowhere is more than an hours drive (and thats going one end to the other!). There is abslutely fkn nowhere that is ""inconvenient"" for the driver to take a passenger.

Nowhere else in the world have I seen this, and damn, I have traveled. As i mentioned, its even actually against the law for taxis to do this in Australia. Ive had better taxi service in run down twenty year old cars in Guatemala than I have had here.

In Singapore, its just not about where you want to go - its about where they want to go, and thats plain bullshit -allowing drivers to do this without repercussion is the mark of a broken system, whereby the public that they are supposed to be servicing is put second to the driver and his convenience and needs.

How often does this happen to you? How do you feel about it? would it be better if laws were put in place to stop taxi drivers doing this? Would it ever happen (doubtful in Sg, in my mind)?

The SG taxi system is utterly broken - discuss.

168,hvxy96,Guide: Transferring between MRT lines,"So, /u/majoshticbeast recently posted a London underground rendition of our trusty system map, and I noticed that one of the design considerations was to add ""OSI""s onto the map. 

Also, people frequently rant about the DTL loop, not knowing that they can simply tap out and tap back in, and get charged the same fare.

In 2018, in response to the huge loop that the DTL makes, the LTA (finally) decided to allow transfers between MRT lines without needing a bus ride in between, so below are some of what I feel are the most useful MRT line to MRT line interchanges that you can make within the (15min) time limit, and what interchanges to avoid (even though some maps show it as possible) so as not to risk getting charged more for 2 rides.

* Rochor to Jalan Besar

Transferring from DTL2 to DTL3 is one of the biggest timesavers, as it takes at least 15mins to travel that loop on a train. Rochor to Jalan Besar is the nearest 2 stations, which almost guarantees you a transfer within the time limit. Transfers to avoid: Litttle India to Jalan Besar, Rochor to Bencoolen

* Esplanade to City Hall

Easily the most useful travel hack for westerners heading to the sports hub/golden mile, as it avoids the mess that is Dhoby Ghaut. This transfer can actually be accomplished within 5mins when the right path is used (via Raffles City), avoiding the labyrinth of Citylink Mall. Transfers to avoid: Esplanade to Bugis, Bras Basah to Bugis

* Downtown to Marina Bay / Raffles Place

For workers who need to get between the Downtown Line and the NSL/TEL, Downtown is the best station to make the transfer. Typically, Marina Bay is fine for both lines. However if you're using the NSL and it's a hot day you can also opt to use Raffles Place instead as it has an aircon linkway. Transfers to avoid: Chinatown to Raffles Place.

* Dhoby Ghaut to Bencoolen / Little India to Jalan Besar

Both are about the same distance from each other and allow for a seamless transfer between the NEL and DTL. Just reme",,MRT line-to-line interchange guide for time savings and fare avoidance,information/news,train service,train service
180,11pb5ox,SSDC: A March 2023 guide to getting your Class 3/3A License,"Having recently passed my class 3 license, I found that the SSDC website is trash and does the absolute bare minimum to provide you with the information you need to obtain your license. Sure, there are guides like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/kc7x2n/december_2020_guide_to_getting_a_driving_license/) which are comprehensive, but I want to write something a bit more up to date and also have this guide serve as the guideline for the next year or so before something changes again and someone else comes along to write another guide. Before this, I would like to thank u/espoir90 for providing me with all the minute details that allowed me to get my license seamlessly and without having to rely on differing info from multiple sources.

I first enrolled in early October 2022, took my BTT at the end of the month, started my lessons the very next day. I booked my TP in late Jan 2023, which I took in March 2023 and passed. I completed my FTT and simulator lessons in mid-Nov 2022. The total number of days it took for me from enrolling to actually getting my license was 152 days, with a timespan of 87 days between my first practical lesson and the one that allowed me to book for my TP test.

The process for getting your license goes somewhat like this. I guess this also serves as the TLDR:

1. Enrol online or on-site (walk-in at 9.30am, 2.30pm & 5pm on Weekdays at Level 3)
2. Photo-taking, eyesight test & receiving your training record booklet. If you enrol on-site, this will happen on the same day
3. Watch the online theory videos. Login to your account in order to access it. There are a total of 4 videos. Watch the first 2 to be eligible to book for your Theory Trial Test (TTT) for your Basic Theory Test (BTT). I will explain how the money-sucking TTT system and videos work below.
4. Book BTT
5. Apply for Provisional Driving License (PDL) ($25)
6. Book practical lessons
7. Book TTT for FTT and then book your actual FTT and pass it before your TP test

On one or two (sometimes every three) lane roads, traffic going straight cannot proceed because they are stuck behind vehicles that cannot yet turn left due to pedestrians crossing, and stuck behind vehicles that cannot turn right because of the red right-turn arrow.

I'm all for removing the discretionary right-turns on busy, high-risk junctions but they are also now needlessly installed at quiet junctions resulting in a jam where everyone is stopped for no good reason.

Edit: Thank you all for your discussion. This is my opinion:

1. I'm not against red right-turn arrows. I understand why we need them. But a blanket implementation on even ulu junctions is a knee-jerk reaction which makes for a poorer overall experience.

2. There should always be a dedicated go-straight lane. If conditions do not allow, the right-turning lane should also allow vehicles to go straight so if there are no vehicles waiting to turn right, traffic can flow straight.

257,17stunh,Making sense of Marine Parade MRT station & Underground Shopping Mall,"With the impending opening of the Marien Parade MRT station, I am trying to make sense of some of the designs.

- the station extends all the way to Still Road with what has been announced as ""underground mall"". Aside from the question if this area really needs another mall (i12 is still struggling to find tenants, PP lost its anchor tenant not too long ago, iMall just finished but hasn't opened yet), I am wondering what is the purpose of extending the underground walkway all the way to Still Rd, since this is not a high foot traffic area at all.

- the stretch between Joo Chiat Rd and Still Rd (which is not the actual MRT station) used to be designated as a linear park and had massive trees, it looked fantastic. Now - despite being underground - nearly the entire stretch is taken up by 4 massive buildings as exit/entry to the mall/walkway, there is hardly any space left for greenery. A simple covered walkway would have made so much more sense?

- the station will have an underground bicycle parking space, but there is actually no way to cycle to the station aside from using major roads.

- none of the MRT exits is linked to any of the existing malls, even the MP market is only somewhat oddly connected in front of Parkway Centre.

- side note, anyone knows why they stopped tearing down the MP CC? It's 90% gone but they stopped work some weeks ago

I can't stop thinking that this entire station could have been planned out better and more efficiently.",,New Marien Parade MRT station design criticism,complaint,train service,other

269,16tafn7,Staying sane when driving (tips and tricks),"Hi all, been driving consistently for 16 years with the last 8+ years as a PHV driver. While I too feel that Singapore drivers are getting less patient, more aggressive and often distracted, driving is still one of my favorite activities and I am here to share some tips for the less happy drivers. 

**Pre-drive routine**: You perceive the world very differently depending on your mood, you create your own reality. Here is my pre-drive routine. After starting the engine, just take 3 slow and deep breaths. Notice what your mood is, how do you feel, remind yourself where you are going and if you are unfamiliar with the route, take the time to go through google map's turn by turn direction. Know that along the way, you WILL encounter kind drivers that you don't notice, as well as assholes that will make their ass-holiness known.

**Game plan**: Have a set of ""mental game plan"" for common situations. What works for me is the following. I will always give way to cars who signal their intentions in advance, I will never tailgate, I will never use my horn in anger or act due to anger, I will always show gratitude to kind drivers by waving or signaling with a quick ""hazard light thanks"", I will never DUI or drive tired, I will never use my phone while driving etc.

**When encountering assholes**: Assholes always seem to pop up suddenly without any warning. Thanks to your pre-drive routine, you would have been more vigilant in expecting them to show up. When I jump scare you at night, you get a rude shock. But if I tell you I will jump scare you when you are otw home later, you might still get shocked but much less right?

First thing is be safe and take immediate defensive actions such as e-braking and creating a larger safety distance etc, basics that you already know from passing TP isn't it.

At the same time, take a deep breath and focus on what you are feeling. Don't judge the situation, it is what it is. That asshole probably didn't wake up in the morning hunting you do",,Experienced driver shares tips for improving mood and avoiding aggressive driving,other,private transport,other
274,1713n5j,The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated,"One thing I've noticed with the PR effort, and likely by extension, the policy thinking, around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive. Have you seen the posters? ""Give your car a break - take TEL3"".

Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/Uploads/Investor_Relations/AGM/sbst_agm_minutes_2019.pdf) that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA's ridership estimates of 500k. [That it still produces losses](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/Details/oral-reply-by-acting-minister-for-transport-chee-hong-tat-to-parliamentary-question-on-keeping-public-transport-fares-affordable) in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.

The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.

Consequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.

It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.

Of the 5 that had issues, 1 of them left me stranded along TPE on the first day of CNY. I had elderly grandparents with me that day, and after contacting GetGo, they ONLY offered a replacement vehicle (which i had to walk 5km for) and a $20 discount for future bookings.

GetGo's fleet, especially its older ones (Mazda 3, Ssangyong Tivoli) are absolutely horrible. I honestly doubt they maintain their vehicles.

To all new drivers or those who intend to use carsharing, PLEASE THINK TWICE. With their insanely high insurance excess and poorly maintained vehicles they're just counting on you to screw up.

If you still decide to use carsharing, pleasepleaseplease check and make sure the car is safe to drive. If at any point you feel uncomfortable with the car, call them to cancel it.

I took my test at SSDC with a private instructor, and here are some of my experiences with him. 

To provide background, he was recommended by a friend, and his website looked quite legit and had driving 'keywords' in the url (**pass driving** in **sg**) so I guess he was not bad at search engine optimization, so I went ahead and hired him. 

1. On my 2nd lesson, he spent much of the time talking loudly on the phone with his lawyer about his divorce. I didn't mind the distraction, but shortly after he had to pick up his daughter from school and repeatedly demanded me to speed up to up to 60km/h even though I have barely learnt the basic maneuvers of a car. Once he got to a suitable place for him to get his daughter, he dropped me off in the middle of a road in Ang Mo Kio instead of the agreed pick-up point at Yio Chu Kang MRT more than 15 minutes early of the 90 minute lesson. 

2. The instructions he gave were vague, and I had to infer what he meant or derive the correct method from which technique you were using when you weren't scolded by him. His words were slurred and difficult to understand. Sometimes, he may even give the wrong instruction and blame me for it. On the day of my 2nd TP test (failed the 1st with him), he asked me to U-turn at a point where I was quite sure U-turning was not allowed, but did so anyway because I trusted his experience. I got shouted at after that because U-turning wasn't allowed and he said he asked me to turn right. You may be wondering why I didn't clarify my doubts with him, but it was because earlier in the lesson, he asked me to turn right and I did, only to get reprimanded because he wanted me to turn left instead.

3. He reprimanded me for things that wouldn't get me penalized in the TP test. Admittedly, I am not as skill",,Bad experience with a private driving instructor in Singapore,complaint,private transport,other

484,yfwpio,"BlueSG launched their new cars, and it’s a step in the right direction…to getting rid of bad drivers.","BlueSG’s recent upgrade from the very French Bollere BlueCar to the latest Opel Corsa-E is definitely a welcome surprise. 

I’ve been a big fan of BlueSG for a little more than a year now due to my hatred of mass public transport, as well as the abhorrence of the prices of decent cars in Singapore. However, the original Bolleré BlueCar isn’t a car that I would happily choose to be driving, it was out of mere necessity and convenience. Let’s get into that before we talk about the latest Opel offering. 

The BlueCar is quintessentially French in a way that it’s *in a horrid French accent* “let’s design a car that is too big to be small, too small to be big. And oh we should uh, put the speedo in the middle and have the dashboard be the width of the English Channel where if you put your phone anywhere near it, it would disappear into a inch wide gap much further than your arms can reach. Also for some reason, the gearstick is the other way around to confuse everyone. And 50hp is tres bien, also also we need the throttle pedal to feel like brake pedal and the brake pedal to feel like the throttle pedal. 

Odd, exceedingly French design a little better than the Fiat Multipla aside, everything about it screamed “look at moi, I am no more zhan 500 euro” down to the extremely bad stereo and stitching (or the lack of). It’s the first car I’ve ever felt that it was a box on wheels that would only be required to ferry me from point a to point b with a high to very high chance of dying before I reach my destination. 

Now to my first drive of the Opel/Vauxhall/Peugeot Corsa-E/208 whatever you wanna call it. I jumped on the old BlueCar to drive about 10 minutes to the nearest Opel that was somewhere in the middle of Pasir Ris with a sense of anticipation to drive the new car, where the driving experience of the older offering definitely amplified.

Man it was absolutely mortifying to have to see the same instructors. Even during the warm up, the instructor was like ‘you dont want to pass today?’. However, the tester was really nice. He made small talk with me, made me feel comfortable. So here are some tips:

- ALWAYS LOOK BACK WHEN PARKING LOOK BACK

- For reverse (no pole): 

Full Lock Right 3.5 blocks (black and white) is at your shoulder

- For reverse with pole: 

Must touch the ledge gently. then must go up. dont touch the pole. Once it touches, drop, then full lock right. Remember to make sure you’re in the centre so that the car wont get stuck in the middle (its an IF)

- For vertical parking: 

drive all the way in-front, make sure your shoulder touches the number. Then reverse till back line aligns w the bar (black/white) in the middle after the corner. Then full lock left. Bring down mirrors to check. (Start Further from curb)

- For Parallel parking:

Bring mirror down. Then when the front door lock handle back touches the end of the curb, full lock left. check the left mirror to see the white block until you see a bit of the black. Then straighten reverse till u touch yellow line. Bring mirror down. Then full lock right. Make sure to reverse before driving off. (Start Close to curb)

- When he slaps the board, E Brake.

- Don’t exceed speed limit when driving outside

- STOP AT STOP LINE (how i failed the first time).

Mentally, i really had to control my breathing. Remember to breathe into your stomach, not your chest (makes you even more nervous.) For those retaking, just think of the circuits. Dont think of whats next, dont think of the points, dont look at the tester. Dont look at his screen. Just be present. If you can take the test, it means you have all the knowledge and skills you need to pass it. Also dont count your eggs before they hatch. The test isnt over till you turn off the engine.

492,1bjajl8,When to give up MRT Seats?,"This question probably has been asked quite a few times, but I just want to be clear, when should one give up their seat? Recently, I keep seeing parents on the train with kids (5-7) who keep asking their parents loud AF “ why I cannot sit?” Whenever this happens, someone will always be guilted into giving up their seat for the kid, and the person beside them will also feel guilty if they don't give up their seat, because it’s like separating the parent and the kid. IMO, the only people who should be given seats are very old, frail elderly (70-80+ with a lot of laorenban or have a full head of gray hair. ), or heavily pregnant women that look like they gonna give birth anytime soon. 

I recall being eyeballed by everyone opp me once when I didn’t give up my seat to a 5-7 yo kid standing in front of me, who kept whining to his parent “why no seats for me?” The kid and parent had gotten on the train after my stop, and alighted before my stop. They stood for a total of 5 minutes. Maybe it was my upbringing, but I never whined to my mom about no seats on public transport when I was a child. I would wait, if someone gave their seat to me, I’ll be happy and my mom would tell me to say thank you. I would be paiseh and grateful to the person. I NEVER felt entitled to a seat just for being a kid. 

People all pay train fare. We are all entitled to a seat on a FCFS basis and we give it up when we want. People have invisible pain. A relative of mine had cancer really young, she looked healthy in the initial stages, but had frequent dizziness and still had to stand on public transport. We don’t know if someone has a longer journey, headaches or menstrual cramps (for females). What we do know is that children 5-7 have no worries, and are less likely to have these invisible pains esp if they have the energy to climb and fidget in a seat.

A family is sitting nearby with their bags and luggage. Anyone else on the train could see that they put their things as close to them as possible, trying their best not to take up space. Lady walks in, without any provocation, and shouts at the family, saying that they make it impossible to sit down in the seat next to the father, because of his luggage. The father moves his luggage out of the way best he can, but she still shouts at them, calling the situation (or them) ""outrageous"".

At the next stop, a new passenger boards the train and she sits next to the father - in the ""impossible to sit down"" seat. The voice recording was after this.

As in the picture, the woman had her umbrella on the seat. At the next stop, an elderly man boarded and wanted to sit in the seat next to her. She had to move her bag and umbrella away for him to sit.

I was preparing to leave at the next stop, the family was going to get off at the same stop. I stood up and told the woman - ""Look, your umbrella was on the other seat and the other passenger didn't have to shout at you to get you to make space. Why did you have to shout at them? Have some compassion."" She shouted back at me something like ""Speak for yourself!"" or something along those lines. Still mega confused about that.

Talked to the family when we got off and found out that they are tourists and they've already been having a really tough time finding their way since leaving the airport. To add to that they had to deal with this. Up to this point, they have never expressed anger or replied rudely or even raised their voice.

Am in contact with them, and told them that if they need any more help or if they want to make a report, to just drop me a text.

804,ad4jtj,Elderly on MRT trains. Why some of them refuse to sit down.,"I did not realise how much of a challenge balancing on a moving MRT was for the elderly until I saw two incidents.

**Incident 1: Elderly man couldn't get up from his seat without help**

An elderly man was hesitant about taking a seat in the middle of the cabin even though someone offered an empty seat to him. He did so with some persuasion. 10 minutes later, I realised why he was hesitant. When the train was reaching his stop, he tried to stand up from his seat in the middle of the cabin. He was unable to get up from the seat by himself with no pole to hold onto. He was waving his arms and trying to stop himself from falling as he got up from the seat on just his two legs. The other commuters had to hold him as he was in danger of falling down.

**Incident 2: Elderly man didn't dare to walk to an empty seat**

Another elderly man was standing in the MRT cabin, surrounded by at least three empty priority seats. I was wondering why he chose to stand, when an auntie started to prod him to sit down in one of the empty priority seats. It turned out that he was afraid of let go of the pole he was holding on to. There was a young man leaning against the partition who was just slightly blocking his path to the empty seat. Just letting go of the pole and navigating that little detour on a moving train was a huge challenge to the elderly man.

**We don't understand the problems of the elderly because we have never been in their position and we look at things from our lenses instead.**

Even I do that. I have a 70-year-old mother. I was out shopping with my Mom. I was right behind my Mom. My Mom had turned her head away for a second and there was a little girl (maybe eight-years-old) who walked into our view from our left. She was going to collide with my Mom in one second. I saw the little girl nearing Mom, and in that split second, I remembered what I was thinking. I was like, ah, Mum will be okie.

824,178xv96,[SSDC] [Class 3A] Passed my driving test today!,"Passed my driving test today! First timer with 14 demerit points. SSDC student. Total of 27 lessons taken (24 practical lessons, and 3 revisions). The posts on this subreddit really helped, so I figured that I should share my experience.

Background:-

1. I have an existing BTT since early 2000s. Signed up for BBDC back in the late 2000s, but did not complete my driving lessons. Took more than a decade to restart my lessons.
2. Decided to learn driving again after some encouragement from my now ex-colleague (thanks Mel). Started in late July/early August 2022.

Sign up process:-

1. Googled for private driving instructors in Singapore. Paid a downpayment to the contact person. Contact person then introduced a private instructor to me. Asked the private instructor some questions, and they were not helpful. Decided to take the loss and sign up as a SSDC school student.
2. No walk in allowed, at least back in late July/early August 2022. Gotta make an appointment online before proceeding to sign up as a student.
3. Sign up process pretty fuss free.

FTT:-

1. Passed during my first try. Think I got 49/50. I downloaded an app on Play Store that serves as a test bank. Did multiple trial tests on the app until I can consistently pass the test, with at least 48  points and above.

Booking practical lessons:-

1. When I started on my learning journey, I booked lessons online, and also used the SSDC bot. Progress was extremely slow due to a big gap between my lessons (for example, my first lesson was on 5th September 2022, and my second lesson was on 12 October). The gap is also partly my fault, given that I have urgent meetings to attend and had to cancel last-minute. Tried to camp for slots, but given that I'm working, it's really hard to snipe try-sells. Had 14 lessons from September 2022 to July 2022.
2. The SSDC bot doesn't seem to work anymore, so I suggest that folks shouldn't use it.
3. Decided to speed up the process by being the biggest irritant to SSDC. I made alm",,Passed driving test after 14 demerit points with 27 lessons.,information/news,private transport,private transport

903,193765e,EZ-Link Card and SimplyGo (and how transition could have been done better.),"Ok with this new move by our Transport authorities, I can try to explain how the Old CEPAS Cards compare to current SimplyGo Cards, and how it could have been done better.

Old CEPAS EZ-Link cards are storage-based cards, basically think of it like your SD Card/USB Stick. Cause the money is stored in the card itself, the card shows its balance when boarding busses/trains/slotted into IU for cars. Issues with the system is say for example you lost the adult card, you basically lost money in it unless you remember the 16 digit CAN ID on the back of said card (since it’s anonymous), or you linked it to the EZ-Link app back in the day. This is different from Concession cards (the ones with ur IC, name and Face on it), since the authorities have more info to track said card and return the money back.

New SimplyGo cards are account-based cards, like your Google Drive account. The money is stored on servers with SimplyGo. I believe the data transmission to the card from servers is to strive between allowing you to board public transport and what relevant info to tell you on card reader hence you cannot see the balance (take my words with salt, I’m basing it on experience with TL Staff and observations). Also, you have to not only maintain a balance of minimum $3 (or else you can’t use the card for 2 days lol), top-ups recommends 10 minutes to update the servers (probably thought of as a small issue since you probably have to wait for a bus but still). One thing about SimplyGo is that if you lost said card and block it, you can transfer the money to your new card. But no inserting to IU, no card balance reading.

Honestly felt that the authorities should have done a different way.

1. Announce suspension of adult CEPAS card issuance and begin sales of only SimplyGo Cards. (They are doing the 2nd part run)
2. Honour remaining CEPAS cards to their Expiry
3. Improve the SimplyGo app, quite buggy still.
4. Innovate to allow card balance to be readable at the card reader.

986,smn0bb,Why do Singaporeans not insist on better bike infrastructure?,"I know... I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity & the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people.  Bear with me 1 sec.   Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun & healthy.  Climate, gradient & size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation.  If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you.  Rain just cools you more!  I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry & clean up.

Only problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful.  Regulations & design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right.  The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs & trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.

Today I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub.  First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail.  Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise).  There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why??
