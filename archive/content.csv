hly3ex,My dream for Singapore: thoughts about transparency and accountability in Singapore,"I posted this a while ago, and thought this is apt to re-post given the significance of this week for Singapore's immediate and perhaps longer-term future. I've also added some fresh thoughts over my last post.

\---

Recent events have made me really think hard about the quality of governance in Singapore, particularly in the areas of transparency and accountability in governance. It has also led me to wonder about the future of government in Singapore, and whether the current system is sustainable.

The Singapore government is transparent only when it wants to be (kudos to daily covid status updates, regular press conferences, and announcements), but the operative keyphrase is ""wants to be"". We don't have freedom of information legislation, so we are kept in the dark about a lot of things. The recent fiasco about POFMA 10m population has also shown that non-information and non-transparency is politically expedient, especially when dual-wielded with the weaponized POFMA.

In terms of accountability, we have seen how PAP MPs broke social distancing rules on a walkabout with absolutely no consequences. When a  similar incident occurred in NZ, the minister was demoted publicly by  the prime minister. We have witnessed a meteoric explosion of covid cases in foreign worker dormitories, with absolutely no consequences, and even an infuriating ""but no worker himself has demanded an apology"" statement from the individual who is most responsible for it. In New Zealand, the responsible minister apologized for 2 new cases. From what I observe on social media and of friends around me, we are maddened, but also maddeningly resigned. In a democracy, the electorate should be electing politicians to serve them; in Singapore, it feels like we are powerless subjects of an all-powerful political institution who grants us limited concessions and freedoms at their pleasure. 

Even constitutional guarantees are not immutable. Our omnipotent political masters have -- just like that, with","['[removed]', '[deleted]']"
1ayiw1d,Falling ill more frequently after moving in together. ,"Hi guys, did anyone experience this before moving in together with your s/o? 

When I was living w my parents, I rarely fall ill (6months once kind), but ever since I've moved in with my partner, I've been falling ill every 2-3months with some degree of flu/stomach issues. 

My hygiene has been consistent before and after moving (I wipe down my phone and bottle with alcohol swabs/wipes after work/gym, I wash my hands frequently cause Healthcare worker etc). 

My partner also has decent levels of hygiene albeit not to my extent, So I doubt it's her that's infecting me. 

Just wondering if yall have experienced this before? Or is it just my body trying to get used to the new environment (6months in)?

14vqkeu,Customer allegedly threatens to 'whack' GrabFood rider and trash his e-bike after drinks are spilled,"
Got a malay customer wanted to WHACK me or destroy my ebike after a spillage . 

Here the story: 
After a spillage ,I met the customer at the rubbish chute under his block . I apologised to the customer plenty of times & followed grab procedures. The customer kept repeated he die die do not want to live chat refund with the customer service and wanted me to go back to the merchant buy back and deliver to him . ( he was preparing to whack me based on his actions , he told me he will throw my ebike to the bin ; his way of saying he will destroy my ebike on spot )  suddenly his friend came .  I offered to pay him to deliver again but he REFUSED . he die die want me go back to the merchant .  

On the hand I got one more order to complete and 2 incoming orders which is far so I was thinking whether I should listen to him by buying his drinks back but his way of talking very very duper super rude (xialan)   . 

The customer that wanted whack me told me he 
used to be delivery food rider before , whenever his spillage he will buy the food/drink back to the customer . 

I was very scared at that point of time & I scared no evidence can capture that I  kena whack or my ebike destroy  because is at RUBBISH CHUTE new BTO teckwhye building even I was on the call with the grab customer service I do not dare/very very scared to tell her on the spot he wanted whack or destroy my ebike ,therefore I just anyhow agreed to buy back . 

In the end I delivered the second order and consulted to my friend what to do . My friend told me just call 999 immediately hence I did. 

I requested to the grab customer service to ban him because CONFIRM + chop next time in the future or in the past this thing happened , he terrorised us riders …  

His car is the blue color .

I really hope this post will get viral and he will learn a lesson .

10xgfui,"Idk if it’s selection bias, but why are the Singaporeans here all earning an insane amount?","
You earn 4k? Too little to survive SG it’s not even much 

You earn 6k? lol that’s like every average Singaporean you’ll just survive but not live

Correct me if I’m wrong but a MAJORITY of Singaporeans are earning about 4.5k. And there’s a whole group who are earning less than 2.6k who aren’t even in the statistics. 

Ffs idk if I’m out of touch with reality but this reddit page made me think that if I don’t earn 10k and above I’m not living life in SG.

Whether what we are earning commensurate with with our job scope and years of experience. Or have I been living in my fantasy bubble and 80% of Singaporeans are earning 10k minimum working as investment backers and software developers at FAANG.

2) Grab driver accepts job and then went MIA , and we have to cancel after waiting for 15-20 mins. Prices went up in the meanwhile and still have to suck it up. 

3) Customer service provided zero service. Robotic responses and sometimes, I question if it’s a bot or it’s a real person answering my questions/feedback. Don’t expect any service recovery.

16iyhtd,How often do u expect ur spouse to contact u or talk to u?,"I (F) am married for 1 year (simple rom), but for the past one year we have been staying apart as we have just received the bto keys earlier this year and settling renovation stuffs. I am feeling very alone in this marriage and I don't know how to go on as it feels like there's almost no love , no affection, no care and concern and no appreciation from him. He's a workaholic and his priority is work , I noticed that whenever his colleagues text him while I'm with him he replies immediately, while for me , the wife, I often have to wait for days for his reply. He finds that it is not an issue going MIA for a week and if I don't text him he doesn't text me. I feel that there's a serious communication issue here or rather an almost one sided communication on my side with almost no communication on his side. 

I started being unhappy and disappointed with our communication during the house keys collection. At that time, even though it is his choice to retain the 20k cpf, it wasn't communicated by him prior despite all my prior communication with him on housing installments were based on if we wipe out each of our cpf. As I didn't have any intention to retain cpf prior , at the moment it feels to me he don't care about me to share prior why/ how it may be useful to retain some amount. I feel disappointed when at the moment I thought I should retain some amount too after hearing that he's retaining, he pointed out that loan amount / cash amount for me will increase if I retain, when it already increased when he retains. (He has a higher pay than me but we are paying for housing loan 50/50.) I think it was supposedly not a big issue because whatever cpf u put in will be returned back when we sell the house, but at that point he found it unfair to be paying more cpf than me. For this issue we have talked and he explained that as he was busy with work at that time so he wasnt thinking properly at that point. 

Subsequently , I was mainly the one settling house stuffs, coordi","['It doesn\'t sound like he wants to marry you. You\'re a ""BTO partner"" not a wife.', ""Don't be a pushover . \n\nYour husband is basically getting a free ID, personal assistant, nicely furnished and renovated house, for no effort. Maybe after you all move in it'll be free housekeeper too. \n\nThere's a difference between not putting effort into house stuff at all, or communicating that you will do most of it because it's your strength and he doesn't have any opinion on furnishings. An involved spouse will still try to help in other ways even if main decision-making design-wise is left mostly up to you. \n\nDoing all the work in a relationship is extremely tiring. He will continue to be passive if you do not make it absolutely clear to him. \n\nIt seems like he has not made any effort at all in the relationship , or negligible efforts. So tell him to go marry his work/boss/colleagues since he seems to be working all the time. Make as big of a scene as you can. Ultimatum style, like what other commenters have said. \n\nIt is totally not normal to MIA for days without a call or text. Unless his work involves going to places he cannot communicate for a few days (eg battlefield, off at sea, etc) \n\nNewlywed time is like the most sweet and loving time, yet he is almost giving you the cold shoulder. \n\nIf he really cannot reciprocate, cut loss and move on.

Notice that his lack of effort throughout this stage should already be red flags which I suspect, deep in your heart you know, but again you just went ahead because you didn\'t want the time spent to be feel wasted.\n\nIn his perspective, he would think: ok lor, this girl so willing to do everything for me, I guess wouldn\'t be too bad to just ROM to get a house. After all, she won\'t leave me cos I am already treating her so badly by letting her do everything, but she still insisted I get married to her and went through with the whole thing.\n\nIf you ask him why are you so bad towards me, he most likely would say: I have always been like this. Why would you expect me to change? You married me despite me treating you coldly and not being proactive. Do you think that I would change for the better just because we got married?\n\nAnd he wouldn\'t be wrong.\n\nIn fact, most women are wrong when they think the men would change drastically after marriage. What you see during dating is what you get, more or less, after marriage. So if you don\'t like, it\'s time to run.\n\nNow OP is reluctant to end this ""relationship"" again because she felt she has spent a lot of time and effort on the house.

I find it quite appalling as my experience in class with him is so different from what the reviews said. I found that the first lesson was alright, he was very nice and patient in explaining all the driving rules etc..

However, starting from the second lesson, i felt like he became frustrated and annoyed at the slightest thing. I’m still able to tolerate all these as I understand teaching so many students a day can be frustrating. However, after the 6th lesson, I started asking to go to circuit, it seemed like his attitude changed even more, all we did is driving around the road and he barely corrected my mistakes, even though I know I did some improper turning etc.. I tried to tolerate his actions and I took more road lessons. I took 16 road lessons in total, no parking or learning of other things. Then he said he only can give me 3 circuit lessons , then I was like wtf ah how can only have 3 circuit lesson to go for test.

He was super patient during the first two circuit lessons, guiding me patiently like 180 degree change. Bare in mind, I didn’t strike kerb or mount kerb at all. When it comes to my third circuit lesson, his true colours came out again. Despite mounting and striking the kerb multiple times, and asking for corrections, he just kept quiet and not say anything then I was like wtf ah my test was in one week time.

At which, at the beginning of the lesson, the sky was still dark and I can’t see the markings at the s course, leading me to strike the kerb multiples time and yet he said nothing despite, me asking for correction.

At a discretionary turning from a side road to a main road, he would literally expect me to wait for ZERO cars, even from more than 200 meters away, (I don\'t actually know the exact distance, but now that I have a driving license, I know that distance is definitely more than enough for a safe turn, or in fact even excessive from a ""defensive"" driving viewpoint).

18f6vi8,LTA needs to acknowledge the capacity issues plaguing the NEL and CCL,"This is a long post so strap in:

Basically, as it stands, CCL and NEL crowding is at a critical level, and the LTA refuses to acknowledge that this problem even exists. They have tried some solutions (for the NEL), but it's far from enough compared to **infrastructure improvements made directly to the lines**. Without their acknowledgement or action, this problem will only worsen as Singapore (and especially the NE region) densifies.

Let me explain everything in that above statement:

# 1. Why are these 2 lines in particular the most acutely overcrowded?

It may come as no surprise to those who commute during the peak using these 2 lines, but waiting 3 or 4 trains has become the norm at certain stations like one-north, Buona Vista, MacPherson, Tai Seng, Hougang, Kovan and Little India. Even barring that, CCL and NEL trains are usually significantly more crowded than their counterparts on other mature lines NSL and EWL. 

As it stands, the NEL is the only line to serve the (now) ultra-dense districts of Sengkang and Punggol. Both have grown to be significantly more dense than the town planners could have ever hoped for (just look at Waterway Point on any day, really), causing the NEL to exceed ridership forecasts by large margins every year. And with new districts like Northshore, Fernvale or even Buangkok Cres coming up over the next few years, ridership is only set to increase by that much more.

The CCL really just has 1 major flaw - it is a 3 car line that serves districts that deserve 6 car trains. Areas like one-north, Science Park/NUS, Tai Seng and even National Stadium are major commercial trip generators which have progressively built up since the opening of the CCL and are continuing to be built today, causing crowding to slowly build and reach the levels that we are at today. This is without even including the connectivity role the CCL plays, being basically the only option for trips from the west (Tuas/Jurong industrial areas) and southeast (Paya Lebar,","['pls cc to this guy too: Chee\\_Hong\\_Tat@mot.gov.sg', 'Well said about the transport system. Our current measures are really penny wise pound foolish. Everyday we act slower on this is a day it cost more tomorrow as Singapore is more built up and more roads have to be diverted to fit any new project.\n\nOne thing I don’t quite agree on is to focus on expanding stations. Building more full fledged mrt like the proposed Seletar line on a tigher timeline can alleviate many of the pains that people have to bottleneck at the current trunk lines. Punggol and Sengkang could benefit from a second line that pulls people off from gathering at the NEL like how Tampines has the DTL that somewhat helped even with its 3 cars. But anything is better than what our 2040 masterplan is so far.', ""My 2c, but I definitely agree that CCL being 3 car was a huge mistake. CCL's crowding problem isn't new. Personal exp of myself taking it to school back in 2015, it was a crowded mess at Buona, and sometimes the trains wld be so packed until yr face could basically be at the door. And personally I wouldn't be suprised if more people have had the same exp from 2011 when or earlier when the line had just opened."", 'Well written article - can you submit this to the Straits Times Forum?

It was planned as separate lines like Bishan LRT, Marina Line. Most of the alignment was like LRT lines. The Circle Line was thought out as an LRT line, BTW. This is a reason for it to be a 3 car instead of the 6 car formation seen in previous lines.\n\nThen you also have the Downtown Line, which also has to be a 3 car since you also have interchange with CCL at Bayfront. It is also partly string together from what was Bukit Timah Line, Downtown Extension (part of what was a CCL Extension. ) and part of Eastern Region Line (at least the northern portion of it).

The result is severe congestion from the north-east to Jurong and one-north.

This straight away DOUBLES the capacity of NEL, provided enough additional trains are bought.\n\nNEL is relatively straight so digging out a third track is probably way more feasible than CCL. There is so much more development coming along the NEL corridor, particularly in Punggol, Hougang and Bidadari. Adding a mere 6 trains, removing seats or adding 1 to 2 carriages per train isn't going to increase capacity significantly. Just double the capacity and future proof the NEL for years to come\n\nCCL is kinda hopeless at this point, a relic of austerity of years past. Maybe LTA can encourage short distance trips to switch to bus instead e.g. between Bishan and Serangoon, Buona Vista and Kent Ridge"", ""I'm someone who takes DTL once in a while and TEL on rare occasion.

It ain’t about adding length to the mainline. Space wise at depot? Hard to cater. It only can expand towards Buangkok. You need more than just stabling tracks to cater for longer trains. But currently, the depot itself has already been receiving complaints about loud noise coming from train horns. So it’s gonna be a bit constrain.\n\nJust introduce normal & direct route services for peak hours and stop complicate the requirements for passengers to earn incentives. Same fare but seats guaranteed although longer, may be attractive. Likewise, bus priority lanes are needed along these routes. Improvements can be done if LTA stop being rigid & maximise profit driven.\n\nOtherwise, bring back the rationalised routes to the NE region to help elevate the load. But doubt LTA will ever do that.', ""The solution doesn't come from LTA. Its for MOM to enforce some levels of WFH, flexi hours etc"", ""Saying this is a LTA problem is a very short-sighted take on the issue.\n\nThe overarching high level problem here is SG's overpopulation. Its not just MRTs that are crowded, even i have to wait for 10-15mins for my caifan during lunch.\n\nSG is overpopulated, and the govt should be tackling this issue. The solution isn't to build more BTOs, or increase frequency of trains, or widen the roads, or build more hospitals (or increase hospital beds), or build more shopping malls to cater to the increasing crowds.\n\nThe only way is to reduce the population of humans. Any person who studies population ecology or environmental biology knows this. In order to ensure long term prosperity, the population size of a species must be kept in check, it can't keep increasing without limit, as the environment will soon be unable to sustain it.\n\nOf course, this isn't a simple issue to solve, but its just that no one's taking about it.

If I’m not wrong Ma on Shan line portion of the tuen ma line is provision for 8 car train even though at the start it operates with 4 cars. Also those portion that need to be extended are open air thus reducing the construction cost. Also is the station capable of handing the extended train or lengthening the station is needed? Those platform overrun might look like platform overrun but in real life there might be thing hiding behind it which I believe is the ventilation shaft (this one I also don’t know need to ask transportation expert on this) Also I don’t think they will pass fire standard too (this one idk need scdf to advice) Unless you want to start digging to increase length of station a bit unfeasible.

8vo7ry,does the Singapore government scholarship system really produces leaders?,"The fact is LKY is a great scholar (double first no less) and being one of the key architects (the chief architect is arguably the British Civil Service system) of our government, he naturally favored academically smart people. I suspect he is also influenced by ancient China’s imperial scholarship system of selecting scholars into high positions. The scholarship system is a key systemic structure of how Singapore works today, with a significant portion of the cabinet, key government appointment holders and stats board CEOs being a result of this system. But does it work?

Here is my understanding. Correct me if i am wrong. 

a. Government scholars especially overseas scholars and definitely President scholars are given choice postings and assignments. They have at their disposal vast resources to make their projects etc a success. When they are successful, that success is attributed to their obvious talent and leadership rather than the vast advantages they have at their disposal

b. their superiors rarely challenge them nor discipline them. it is a wag the dog situation unless the superior is an even more prominent scholar. 

c. they are normally surrounded by yes men who benefit by saying say. later these yes men and women benefit by being promoted alone with their scholar benefactor(s) and thus we end up with a top full of yes men and scholars who only know yes for an answer

d. all these breeds arrogance in even the most well meaning scholar. most of them join with the best of intentions and by all measures , are probably really good talents. But having been sheltered from the realities of honest feedback, failures,retrenchments, consequences of poor performance etc (that we all face in the private sector) coupled with high salary, high office, and having never been wrong , u end up with an arrogant person who thinks he or she is God’s gift to Leadership

When tested in real challenges, like turning around failed companies (NOL), or failing industries (SPH) or ","['Some views\n\nIdentifying leadership at age 17/18 on the basis of academic scholarship is worth a second look. \n\nSecondly, the usual 2 year to 3 year rotation in posts naturally motivates candidates to aim for short and mid-term goals which are tangible and easier to show to move up the ladder although PSC and the leadership do point out that its their personal attributes and potential that are rated.\n\nWhat is even quite remarkable is that someone who did not do well in A levels, repeats the year can still get OMS and get admitted to Admin Service.  \n\nPersonally things like group think, arrogance, are common in the private sector and elsewhere in society. \n\nDisagree on the comment about not being challenged. They are indeed challenged but the scheme allows for continued tenure for those not on par to be given soft postings because of the size of the civil service. \n\nMany are bright, true assets but unable to function in environment and bring out their potential due to the increasing politicisation of the upper echelon of the Civil Service. In the past, you would hear Perm Sec making incisive and critical comments in the press - JY Pillay, Lim Kim San, Boggars, Ngiam etc. Have you heard a single critical comment from a Perm Sec besides interviews on themselves or the minister from ST. \n\n \n\n\n', '> We used to be a great nation.\n\nI must have missed that Social Studies lesson.', 'From my experience, (a) and (b) aren\'t true.

You become more noticeable and more proficient in your job scope simply because of the exposure given. It is truly an unfair advantage that is given to us. \n\n2. The culture of yes men are not reall seen from my perspective, hierarchy is strictly adhered to despite scholarship level and not everyone is trying to angkat bola. \n\n3. I have met many other scholars from the organisation and they are all pretty proud and hold their heads up high. However, my sensing is that it is not built solely from being a scholar. The cornerstone to this attitude would be from the very start of education. If you come from a privileged household and a top tier school, 9/10 fellas come out being pretty arrogant. Attaining a scholarship merely boosts their ego. There are very few of us that come from more difficult backgrounds. The majority are a carbon copy from hwach or RI (No offence)\n\n4. Scholars are no way the best of our batch. They may be the best academically but fall short in many other aspects. From my experience many are bookworms and hardworkers but do not excel as much in social interactions and enjoying life in general. Unfortunately Singapore acknowledges academics as THE MOST important aspect to attaining a scholarship and due to this criteria, the kind of scholars we see are produced. \n\n5. That being said there are many excellent scholars out there that are absolutely amazing at what they do  and excel in what ever is thrown to them. \n\n6.

10kre33,Are dual loop feeder bus services still relevant today?,"This discussion is open to fellow redditors who frequently use dual loop feeder services, as well as bus enthusiasts with any insight into this matter.

For context, dual loop feeder services, formerly known as Townlink (SBST/Go-Ahead) or Intra-Town (SMRT) services, provide direct connections between various neighbourhoods within a residential estate without the need for transferring between buses or the MRT/LRT. Such feeder services typically serve the bus interchange / town centre bus stop twice along their journeys, functioning as both a feeder service between neighbourhood(s) and the town centre, and connecting different neighbourhoods within a town together. There are currently 13 dual loop feeder services operating in Ang Mo Kio (265, 268), Bedok (222), Choa Chu Kang (307), Pasir Ris (358, 359), Tampines (291, 293), Woodlands (911, 912, 913) and Yishun (811, 812).

Update (26/1/2023): Only feeder services that were integrated from 2 separate feeder services between 1996 & 1997, as well as those indicated as Townlink by SBS/SBST or Intra-Town by TIBS, are considered dual loop feeder services. While there are other feeder services such as 228, 229, 231, 232, 235, 240, 243, 282, 298, 315, 325, 372, 381, 410, 800, 807, 913M & 941 that provide direct links between 2 or more neighbourhoods in an estate, they will NOT be considered as dual loop feeder services for this discussion.

In old newspaper archives, the launch of Townlink/Intra-Town services were marketed by SBS/TIBS to ""improve intra-town links between neighbourhoods within an estate"" and ""reducing the hassle of transferring between buses to travel between neighbourhoods"". Some incentives, such as cheaper fares compared to transferring between 2 feeder buses, and the deployment of air-con buses (at a time when feeder services exclusively used non-air-con buses), were also promoted in these articles, both of which have become obsolete with the launch of distance fares in 2010 and a fully air-con bus fleet fr","[""Bro idk what you're saying but I'm just in awe by how dedicated you are to such matters 💀💀 LTA needs more people like you fr"", 'Still relevant, in my opinion (Woodlands) \n\n1) Transfer between bus service is not very reliable either. It may incur additional travelling time, and will often caused inconvenience at times. Making a trip on 911 to Av2 and transfer to 169/903, may ended up time saving of 0 or -5mins(extra time). The waiting time may not be in favour if there’s limited service. Wet weather, the bus stop bay May not be sufficient to even fit 2x 12m buses safely. \n\n2) While demands for dual loop travel may not be always high, I think having feeder/intratown may cut down the queue for parking space inside the interchange itself. Supplementing buses often park aside and not utilise the parking space reserved for full day buses. \n\n3) Reliability may not always be bad for these service. For instance, sv911/913 still manage well despite having minor delay at times. During Peak hours, additional trips are done by 911T/913T to reduce overcrowding. This also means bunching frequently occur(2-3 buses at a go), but without compromising the intervals for the subsequent buses. They usually run on their own schedules/headway. Last time, these service are considered “express” as they will skip stops whenever the main service is at the stop. Crowd at last few stops can have a better chance to board the bus also.\n\n4) Longer distance dual loop service can consider 912’s approach, if necessary. But that may cost additional parking lots/resources.\n\nFor Woodlands, apart from the poor 912 reliability which has improved since 912/A/B, I think 911/913 should not follow the way 912 operates. \n\nAn improvement to any feeder/dual loop feeder would be to have flexibility in running supplementary buses to adhere to good headways. For instance, they can deploy 903M/911T during checkpoint jams to ensure that there won’t be long waiting time for the rest of the residences along the route. SMRT done a few times by operating 903M out of the original schedule, which I think it’s worth noting in effort to provide good s', ""Speaking solely for Yishun, it's high time to review the current feeder services and decide if they should get a total revamp.\n\nOver the past 10 years, not only have the interchange been moved, but there have been the addition of 2 new neighbourhood centres/malls (Junction 9/Wisteria Mall), an new hawker centre and (by my estimate) about 20,000 new dwelling units mostly along Ring Road and Ave 6 whose connectivity remains poor."", 'Bus 317 to serangoon gardens is dual loop by necessity. In fact every bus that goes to the circus there has some properties that qualify as dual loop, because it’s just this one out-of-the-way stop that has no opposite side. There used to be an interchange where the main car park is now.']"
128plry,A food delivery guy on an e-bike almost hit my baby in her stroller today.,"I suppose this is more of a rant than a discussion. I want to clarify that this took place at an off-peak hour (12pm on a Saturday) on a pedestrian path where e-bikes are banned. There was a scaffolding that blocked the T-path that I was approaching, and my spidey-senses told me to check before pushing the stroller out. Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out “sorry sorry” as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number. He told me he seemed apologetic and he let him go, where the rider then dismounted and pushed his e-bike until out of our sight.

This is where the struggle comes in: because there was no hit / damage, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t report him as I don’t know what platform he works for. I can’t get the police involved as there is no license tied to his vehicle, despite a legal ban that was laid out to prevent exactly such incidents. 

I am not against riders - I deeply respect that they are out there to make their livelihoods, but is your delivery more important the safety of my child, or your own safety? Is the near-miss not enough for you to feel to need to slow down and check if we are okay? Are you going to blatantly ignore this incident and cause a bigger, more painful lesson for someone else or for yourself?

Should we have collided, your “sorry” will not un-scar my 9 month old, or me. Your biggest issue would not be a missed delivery, and both your day and mine would have turned out very differently. You’re still out there making deliveries because I hesitated to push my baby’s stroller out onto the pedestrian path that I had every right to access on a Saturday afternoon. I don’t know what else I can do but to share this incident for more awareness towards pedestrians and riders alike to not take our road safety for granted.

18y8804,Opinion: Most of Singapore's current problems is due to overpopulation,"Just got to thinking about most of the problems that people around me tend to complain about which made me come to a conclusion that many of these problems are due to the sheer number of people cramped on a tiny island vying for too little resources, and that many of these problems could be resolved if we could hypothetically reduce the population drastically.

A couple of issues I was thinking about.

&#x200B;

1. **Housing Crisis**: The long queues for houses and the frustrating process of applying for BTOs (Build-To-Order flats), often leading to multiple rejections or settling for less desirable units, are clear indicators of overpopulation. The demand far exceeds the supply, leaving various groups, including singles and the LGBT community, struggling to find a place in this tight market. This housing crunch is a direct result of too many people vying for limited space. The ratio of buyers to available units are 10, 12 or even 15 times the number of actual availability. Imagine a group of 10 sharing a meal meant for one.
2. **Overburdened Public Services**: The strain on public services is evident in the long queues at polyclinics and the difficulty in securing medical or dental appointments. Hospitals are overwhelmed, struggling to provide beds even for those with severe health conditions. This pressure on healthcare systems is a consequence of having too many people needing services that are limited in capacity. Try to get an appointment at any polyclinic it is impossible. Try to get one at a dental clinic, you need to queue many months in advance. Doctors and nurses are overburdened. Even beyond healthcare, everything else is jammed up from usage of public gyms to public transport to public parks. Everything a facility is made available for public, you can imagine 1000 others going for the exact same thing. Pools are filled to the brim, parks are crowded a f, malls are crowded and all F&B are fully seated, Gyms have 3 people waiting for one station.
3. **Auto","['No, I think the problems stem from Singapore\'s over-arching ""need"" to keep upping the GDP. That underlies the large number of immigrants and foreign workers. And the long working hours and lack of work-life balance.\n\nThere is no shortage of primary school places if everyone is ok with any school nearby. MOE has been merging schools due to the falling number of kids. There is only queuing, balloting, volunteering etc because of the sense of competition to give their kids a leg up in the race to become a high earner.\n\nIn other words, it is not that there are too many people taking part in the race. It\'s not like there\'s a fixed number of winners and more people means lower chances to win. It\'s the culture of ""if you\'re not in the top X%, your life sucks"". In fact, the race never ends. No matter how fast the pack leaders are running, the govt is hoping that they will run even faster and everyone will run faster to up the GDP. \n\nOverburdened public services is because of people not viewing those public service jobs as ""being in the top X%"" whether in salary or prestige. The government is paying nurses way too little, so nobody wants to be a nurse as it\'s not a good way to win the race.\n\nAs for job market saturation, Singapore already has a disproportionately high proportion of people working in high value white collar office jobs. It is not that there are not enough of such jobs for the population; there are plenty, with people working on projects serving other markets while in Singapore. It is that everybody wants a high value white collar office job, and then there\'s the vicious cycle of needing to import foreign workers to do blue collar jobs, which depresses the salaries of blue collar jobs, which makes blue collar jobs even less desirable. \n\nFor leisure activities and space, I feel that Singapore has quite a lot of parks and nature reserves you can hang out at for free, but they are not popular with locals. It\'s only the events organized by companies that are hyped', 'Ok Thanos', 'A lot of doom and gloom for a chilly Thursday afternoon', 'Counter argument: Singapore is too small, we need to annex Johor. /s', ""Less people doesn't mean more resources going around.

This can be seen on a daily basis starting from 6.30am when lifts coming down are packed. With recent increase in allowable tenants in properties this gets worse. Crowded trains, arguments over seats, rising and sustained property prices as well as rising cost of goods and services cannot be overlooked.\n\nI guess we have to lie on the bed that we made unless the next generation of leaders coughs up a visionary like the first generation.

17xxt9z,Why are parking spaces decorated with patches of grass?,"Hello all, as an expat, I notice how there are parking lots that are decorated with patches of grass.  These are usually found in HDB or apartments.  Sometimes, I can even spot some in public parking lots.  They usually look like this: https://www.hdb.gov.sg/car-parks/parking-lot-line-markings

Dont get me wrong, I am very impressed with Singaporean parking skills.  You guys dont even need the 2 stoppers at the back to stop the back wheels, and still park the cars perfectly everytime.   

My question is why would there be patches of grass? Isnt it easier just to leave the space blank with different tile colors? Because when the car is parked, dirts may drop to these patches and it maybe difficult to take care of the grasses?

Well, it seems that the people at LTA/SMRT have taken notice of my post, as I was told by a few other train otakus yesterday that the estimated travel timings on the platform line maps at Woodlands North & Woodlands stations have been increased, and are now close to what I have recorded previously.

So I went to check the platform line maps of all TEL stations, and all of them have been updated as of 9 December, 6.30pm.

With the updated line maps, they now show your estimated travel timings more accurately than the previous maps. This is evident when the cumulative travel times of all TEL stations from Woodlands North now have less than a minute deviation from my actual recorded timings, as shown in the updated table below.

Since its opening, I have been taking the entire TEL up and down frequently, and have made some observations about the line.

**1. How accurate are the travel times on platform line maps along the TEL?**

Although the distance between two consecutive stations along the TEL is shorter in the city area, I still find it odd that it only takes 1 min to travel between most of them, especially when including the time that the trains dwell at the stations. For reference, I will embed the links to the platform line maps here:  
[Woodlands North towards Gardens by the Bay](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QZ6j9nK7A6EvAUVaA)  
[Gardens by the Bay towards Woodlands North](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f6Hw1YP95isdTPc77)

I used the stopwatch on my phone to time the duration that the train takes to travel from one station to another and indeed, the actual duration is significantly larger than what is stated on the platform line maps, as stated in the tables below.

When I recorded the data, all travel timings between two consecutive stations and dwell times at stations were taken at least 3 times each to ensure consistency and averaged. All timings were recorded outside of weekday peak hours, so I am not sure whether these timings will increase during weekday peak hours.

To avoid making the post too long, I will post the travel and dwell times for individual stations separately in [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LO1lB0jptt8UJnlUYUd3KxYqSmKoyvIauf6DNYVlb5w/edit?usp=sharing) for those who are interested.

13ga0fg,Is there something amiss with the Jurong Region MRT plans?,"I am usually a great admirer of Singapore’s urban planning and public transportation system. However, when I look at the plans for the upcoming Jurong Region Line, I can’t help thinking that there are major issues which don’t seem to be fully considered by LTA:

https://landtransportguru.net/jrl-alignment-map/

Let’s first consider some facts:
- The upcoming Tengah state, as well as the ongoing expansion of Jurong state, will massively increase the population of the West (I would guess 50%)
- The East-West line is already completely packed
- Jurong East is already Singapore’s most overcrowded and chaotic station. Not just because of the number of people, but also because it’s quite old with narrow platforms that can’t barely fit the commuters using the station
- East is planned to have 4 lines to outside the region, including 3 that go directly to the CBD. West has only 1

However, instead of creating an alternative route to the CBD, Science Park and other business centers, the JR line will essentially route everyone in the West to Jurong East. Even to take the Cross Island line you need to go to Jurong East and then change again at Clementi. The JR line connects to Chua Chu Kang, but I don’t think it’s useful as you need to transverse the whole Bukit Panjang LRT to transfer to Downtown Line. So you have no choice but to transfer from red line to green line via… Jurong East.

I know that the government planned to create a new CBD in Jurong area, but now that seems unlikely with the HSR cancellation. And even if it will eventually happen, there is no way the 100s of thousands of people who will soon be living in Tengah and Jurong will be all working in the West.

I am missing something? Does LTA has some secret plan to prevent the collapse of green line and especially Jurong East station? (I dunno, some new train technology that will allow 15 second train intervals or so?)","['The new CBD is going to happen with or without HSR. Most of the govt main offices in both ministries and stat boards will be shifting there.', 'Time for the eventual ""The Jurong Regional Line sucks, here\'s why"" video from Tehsiewdai or Transit Evolution.', '(1) East-West line is getting a significant upgrade this year. Signalling system will allow higher train frequencies.\n\n(2) new Cross-Island line to be fully opened in 2032 to move traffic out of Jurong industrial site to the north east. No need to go to Jurong East.\n\n(3) Jurong Line interchange at CCK will move north-bound traffic away from Jurong East. Basically bypassing the NS1-NS4 stations. It will decrease the north-bound traffic.\n\nDon’t worry. The PAP has already planned out the transport infrastructure plan long in advance.', 'They’re also looking if it’s feasible to extend the JRL from Pandan Reservoir to Haw Par Villa. If they do, most probably might create an interchange at West Coast with the CRL.\n\nThen CRL phase 3 will most probably intersect with one of the stations on JRL in the Jurong industrial estate.', 'Yup everyone is going to consolidated at JE interchange and it’s gonna be crowded AF… the train is gonna be packed arriving from pioneer,boon lay, lakeside. \n\nFYI, People in Clementi, you will have ZERO chance of getting on during peak hour.', 'You are correct with your observation.\n\nThe EW line is going to be incredibly crowded and residents who have to use it will suffer. \n\nThis is especially so for those (BB, CCK, Yewtee) who have to change trains at Jurong East because there is no chance those people will get a seat from those who are already on the train.\n\nSo for those people mentioned above who have no access to DT line, good luck. \n\nI have taken EW line for decades and it’s just much slower than other lines.']"

6lq9km,I wouldn't mind COE if I had reliable public transportation. But I don't. [SMRT Red Line Rant],"The red line is already sluggish and stuttery as it is. 

I used to be pissed off at how it's always slow, always stopping midway for no absolute god damn reason. But I've gotten used to it hence which is why I plan my journeys to and from my Polytechnic 20mins early nowadays. 

But no on many god damn situations 20mins isn't enough to compensate for the absolute gobshite that is the Red Line. Such as today. 

# 30 MINUTES DELAY? I'VE BEEN STANDING ON MY FUCKING LEGS ON THIS FUCKING PLATFORM FOR THE LAST FUCKING 45 MINUTES.

Either do two things Singapore, improve one of your main railway lines or end the COE program so that all of us can get the reliable transportation we need. 

-----

Now onto SMRT.

Seriously, who is the absolute cunt that's operating SMRT? 

 WHAT IS THE POINT OF NEW SHINY TRAINS IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN THEM ON AN UNRELIABLE SYSTEM?

New trains, new this, new that, waste millions of our dollars on nothing. The old refurbished trains do their job well. Why aren't you making train services reliable? I can't give an absolute shit about those new trains.

It's like putting bling on your rusty truck that's going to die. It's not going to extend its lifespan or improve it.

-----

Anyways back to my main point, I'm annoyed that in Singapore you can't have reliable transportation especially if you live along the red line. I wished I could get $3000 used cars without paying COE like what my Australian cousins are doing.

> Before you tell me to fuck off to Australia, I still have not served my NS. So yeah, I would be a fugitive if I were to migrate over now and not return back. I wouldn't have money in the first place to migrate anyways.

**EDIT**

I guess I have worded my rant a little wrongly, *what I was having in mind by my phrase ""Either abolish COE or improve public transportation"" was that the LTA-SMRT would force themselves to improve the trains because abolishing CEO will never be a sensible solution.*","['I thought this [ST article gave an interesting analysis](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/lessons-from-past-mistakes-can-help-smrt-stay-on-track) of our screwed-up lines and mess of a resignalling project.\n\n>In July 1997, then SMRT managing director Kwek Siew Jin announced that the North-South, East-West lines would be upgraded. The project would have cost $100 million, be completed by 2002, and would have allowed trains to travel at a peak frequency of once every 90 seconds. That project never began.\n\n>Fast forward to 20 years later, the current resignalling project costs nearly twice as much, is slated to be completed by next year, and will allow trains to travel at a peak frequency of once every 100 seconds.\n\n>If Singapore had carried out what Mr Kwek had announced 20 years ago, many of the woes commuters have been facing in recent years - and indeed, will continue to face for some time - would have been less severe.\n...\n>SMRT, back then, had already recognised that the system was soon about to reach design capacity, and steps had to be taken to increase that capacity.\n\n>But, for reasons that are still unclear, the project never took off. It was talked about time and again during the 10-year period when Ms Saw Phaik Hwa was at the helm, but nothing gained traction.\n\n>It was only after the major twin breakdowns of 2011 - in which the North-South Line shut down on two days - that plans to rejuvenate the two old lines were set in motion. \n\nSaw Phaik Hwa cut maintenance budget and pushed to set up retail stores in mrt stations, a decision that the COI on the 2011 breakdowns decided was a contributing factor.', ""Yeah. I agree. That's the deal - you make cars expensive, but you make public transportation cheap and reliable. Never in the history of Singapore have the trains been so unreliable."", 'Actually pity SMRT for taking so much heat while LTA, which is the govt body and the one who sourced for the new CBTC quietly hides behind.', 'Why are people comparing with other countries saying, Country XXX has it worse. Is this some kind of self comforting statement for a problem?\n\nAnd when you are comparing something, shouldnt you compare with something better? I dont see people saying, XXX is earning lesser than me, so it is alright for me not to have a pay raise.', 'Want better mrt?

', ""for people who are saying that ABC cities in other first world countries have it worse. please don't make such comparison, Singapore has established the reputation of good public transportation (at least better than neighboring countries), and drastic drop in quality should not be acceptable. conversely, it is like saying Singaporeans should not be proud of their \\*InsertWorldClassAchievementHere\\* because some other countries are better at it.\n"", ""Here is an unpopular opinion:\n\nSingapore's *transit system* is very bad compared to other transit cities like Melbourne, London or New York.\n\nWHAT?!? you say, how can that be??? Singapore number wan!!! You're mad!! World class system, don't anyhow accuse my MRT!\n\nLet me explain: Transit planning is a matter of balance between reliability, efficiency and cost. You see, putting *everyone* on transit and limiting other travel mode options is a bad idea. Your travel is at the mercy of the operators. At first is 5mins, then 15, then 1hr. So, gradually you have to wake up earlier, get home later and spend more time waiting in traffic. \n\nIn comparison, cities that offer many modes of travel have better efficiency of the transit and road systems. The load is spread out across road users, transit users, cyclists, walking etc. More importantly, it forces transit operators to maintain reliability. For example, if the train breaks down too often, commuters will switch to driving or taxis. Yes, overall, the cost of transit will be higher, but on average, across different modes of travel, the cost is lower. So now it becomes which mode (car, cycling, bus etc.) will be more efficient for the commuter, instead of maximizing the number of transit ridership.\n\nSo there you have it. You cannot choose anymore (in reality, the choice is an illusion), and you being on time is now up to SBS/SMRT. Do you want to wake up early every day in *anticipation* of a train delay? or have to plan ahead everytime you take the train? "", 'Abolishing COE would drastically increase the number of cars on the roads, creating massive jams. Occasional 30min train delay vs 1h car commute, tough choice...\n\n\nPeople always mention to compare MRT with NY, Tokyo, London or Paris public transportation, but you should actually check out those  cities for what happens when you have no cap on number of cars.', ""Something something ungrateful people nowadays... something something compare with other countries... something something not happy migrate la...\n\n/s\n\nBut in all seriousness, I love Hong Kong's MTR and bus system. Its so extensive and easy to navigate. Never have I felt a need to take taxi or Uber there. SMRT on the other hand, being stuck at Raffles Place for almost 10 mins yesterday, awkwardly facing another guy that we were almost kissing, I was frantically checking Uber/Grab. Sorry if I caused the fares to jump :("", ""If you think standing for 45mins in a jam is bad imagine atleast 1.5 hours maybe 3? In a traffic jam.. \n\nWhen COE spiked to an all time high of 98K there was still demand, it seems like we have yet to price out Singaporeans, average Singaporeans even. Now just think about what happens when every family gets a car. It won't just stop at one though, with all that pent up frustration of not having a car, you'd likely get a car buying frenzy where every legal driver in a family gets a car. I suppose then we can all just be in our cars saying HAH fuck those peasants that take public transport, I'm way happier in my car :D\n\nI get it that you're just ranting but all I think of is the horrific daily KL jams when I think of a Singapore without Coe. Your car would be utterly useless and inconvenient. "", '[deleted]']"
6xze4c,So the submission of bids for the CR151 has just ended...,"Some backstory:
The C151 (oldest rolling stock on the North-South East-West Lines) trains are approaching 30 years of age, and LTA has opened up bidding for trains to replace the existing trains on the NSEWL. The new trains will be called CR151. More information on bidders can be found [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/tender/doc/13146/R151_Tech.pdf).

&nbsp;

All of this is all fine and dandy, until you realise that **""Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., CRRC Qingdao Sifang Co. Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries (Singapore) Pte Ltd. and Singapore CRRC Sifang Heavy Vehicles Service Pte. Ltd. Consortium""** is bidding for the CR151 contract. You may be asking ""What's wrong with this?"". Well, in Singapore, CSR Sifang/CRRC Sifang trains have been known to cause many issues. More information can be found [here](https://mothership.sg/2016/07/we-summarise-wth-is-going-on-with-mrt-train-cars-being-shipped-back-to-china/) and [here](https://www.factwire.org/single-post/2016/07/05/China-manufacturer-for-MTR-secretly-recalls-35-Singapore-subway-trains-after-cracks-found) and [here](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/07/05/did-smrt-and-lta-hide-defects-of-china-manufactured-trains/) and [here](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/china-made-mrt-trains-sent-back-to-fix-defects). Not only that, the CRRC Sifang China made trains also have a whole other host of problems, such as battery boxes busting, and faulty STARiS displays (the blinking LED line maps you see), among others. SMRT has even suspected that they were the cause of the major train disruptions in 2011.

&nbsp;

With this in mind, you would think that LTA would never choose Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CRRC Sifang again. **That's where you're wrong!**. LTA has picked the consortium not once, but **three** more times even after knowing about the faults. That's for the C151B, C151C and CT251 contracts. It is more than likely that they will pick Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CRRC Sifang again. 

&nbsp;

Let'","['Haha, you\'d be surprised. Allow me to illustrate.\n\nEven the new trains were built by Alstom (for NECCL) and Bombardier (for DTL) in China, by other factories, Shanghai Alstom Transport and CRRC Changchun respectively. The last time we had a train *not* built in China was the original C830s, shipped all the way from France. That drove up costs.\n\nNow, CRRC, or China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, is a giant conglomerate able to abuse the heck out of economies of scale, with about 15-20 facilities across China. Each facility is free to choose who to partner with, so long as profit goes back up the food chain. In the former case, Kawasaki partnered with Qingdao Sifang, and Bombardier with CRRC Changchun, and both companies through these partnerships will always be able to build cheaper than the competition. (like for example Shanghai Alstom which is outside the CRRC umbrella)\n\nFurthermore, at the risk of getting sued, I daresay that LTA and Kawasaki are pretty much in bed together. The only reason why we even use Alstom on NECCL was because back then Kawasaki, a Japanese manufacturer, didn\'t have the experience with automated trains that Alstom had, and Alstom could hence offer a complete solution while Kawasaki could not. Our NEL is just a supersize version of Line 14 in Paris. And the CCL is largely similar.\n\nEDIT to clarify: Contracts are not evaluated purely on cost, as I elaborated in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6xze4c/so_the_submission_of_bids_for_the_cr151_has_just/dmjlaxs/). ""Pre-existing relationships"" often help in the technical tender evaluation, especially for fleet additions/replacements.\n\nThe problem here is that Kawasaki\'s factory in Kobe is fully tied up because every suburban railway in Tokyo wants to replace trains by 2020 because of the Tokyo Olympics. Thus, other Japanese manufacturers like J-TREC (formerly Tokyu Car), Hitachi, and Nippon Sharyo, are also fully occupied. Hence, Kawasaki has no choice but to build in', 'In my view, the handling of bids and tenders should be accountable and well-audited. There is the need to understand that tenders and contracts awarding should be undertaken and reviewed by experts. There is next to zero value in getting the laymen involved.\n\nWhat you are trying to do here (to directly ask for the support for a particular bidder) amounts to an attempt to influence such official processes through social media.  \n\nI am not opposed to applying a greater amount of scrutiny to such processes, but at the same time, we need to understand that such efforts should be strictly separated from the favouring of any single bidder which is participating in any bids. Procurement processes should follow the industrial regulations. **It should not be turned into a popularity contest.**']"
o66y97,Mini-LPT: Understand public transport transfer rules to save abit of money,"**Credits: https://landtransportguru.net/distance-based-fares/ You can read about this in more detail there.**

Our buses and trains currently operate using distance-based fares, based on what is shown [here](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/img/map/bus/fare-table.pdf).

You’ll notice that the fares don’t actually start at $0.00; for example, an adult starting his trip will incur a $0.92 “starting fare” just by tapping in.

However, most trips consist of more than 1 bus/train ride. As such, LTA laid out a few rules for transfers between rides; by following these rules, the next bus/train ride can be considered a continuation of the trip, with the total distance added up for the final fare. If the rules are broken, the tap-in will be considered a new trip, hence re-incurring the starting fare.

The transfer rules are as follows:
1) *A total of 5 transfers can be made in a single trip. Each transfer (i.e. the time between a tap-out and the next tap-in) must be within 45 minutes.* This gives a total of 6 separate bus/train rides per trip. However, this does not apply to transfers between train stations (see point 4).

2) *The time between the first and last tap-in must be less than 2 hours.* The time of the last tap-out doesn’t matter.

3) *The same bus service number cannot be taken consecutively.* However, it **can** be taken non-consecutively e.g. with a ride on a train or even on another bus service in between.

4) *Transfers directly between different train stations are allowed, but must be made within 15 minutes.*

5) *No tapping out and in at the same train station*. The only exceptions are at stations with unpaid links between lines (e.g. Tampines, Newton); for these cases, the transfer must be made within 15 minutes.

So, by keeping within the rules, we can try to keep within a single trip, such as when we are doing short trips for quick errands. This allows us to incur the starting fare only once.

For example:

- For starters, I believe the 45-minut","['The 45min limit is the most important. I keep to this when going on my grocery runs: Feeder Bus A to the destination, quickly grabbing what I need, then Feeder Bus B back. Saves about $1 each time, so about $100 a year!', 'I have friends who alight from trains and then walk a few bus stops before taking the bus so that he/she will get the 0.00 transfer. However this requires that you know the route really well.', 'Reads like some sort of speed run optimising strats.', ""What I really want to know is, can I tap out for free to use the restroom if my bowels suddenly decide to not cooperate mid-commute. The good thing about train stations in say Tokyo is that there are restrooms within the ticketed areas so you don't have to tap out to relief yourself."", 'food', 'great tip, never knew that the 2 hr limit was the last tap in and not the last tap out. is there any time limit for a single trip? like say if i stayed on the train for >2hrs?']"
8txrld,An informal legal analysis on oBike’s ability to abscond with your deposit,"**UPDATE:** 

oBike was reported to be undergoing liquidated a few hours after my post. Most things within my post are still relevant. My personal course of action from handling similar cases - I personally contacted my credit card company you used to pay the deposit to initiate the chargeback process on the grounds of services not provided. Still, it may be for naught because the company have not have assets left to pay creditors, and I have no knowledge of how chargeback claims are construed, but it MAY be that if you go through the chargeback process, the credit card and thus merchant bank's obligation to refund your money may rank you higher in the list of creditors (since the Bank will be the entity which is recovering the sum instead of you as an individual consumer).

TLDR: 

oBike leaving, T&C with consumers states that can unilaterally convert your deposit into sVIP membership. 

oBike corporate structure and the operation of company law may mean that oBike is not obliged to refund its consumers. 

No legal resource as no governmental agency oversight (CASE is a NGO), and small quantum of claim $49 makes it unlikely for anyone to pursue a legal action. 

Edit: regulatory recourse may be available under the The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act - see last paragraph!

Warning and disclaimer: Wall of text. I’m a legally trained but not practicing law, and done with a cursory understanding of the law without any legal research so take this analysis with a bucket of salt.  

**Context**

We’ve recently received news that oBike is looking to cease operations in Singapore. We have also had many users reporting the difficulty and inability to have their deposits refunded to them. Personally, my oBike app has removed the refund option under the deposit tab, and others are blocked from accessing features of the app due to a pop-up that won’t go away. Others have their refund request pending for over a month.

Unfortunately for you all, the parent company which owns 100% of Obike Asia is Obike Hong Kong, so I didn\'t want to go up one more tier unless there is someone that can pull up the profile from Hong Kong.

2lbyrx,"Its not about you, its about them (or, how I learnt to hate the Singapore taxi system)","In Melbourne, where I am from, it is an offence for a taxi driver to cherry-pick fares. Here in Singapore, it seems an acceptable practice.

Lines and lines of taxi drivers last Friday night kept passing. Forty five minutes, and I counted (guestimated) 55 cabs that slowed down, asked where we were going, and then sped off. Finally, we had to resort to bribery ""we will give you extra money if you take us, please, no one is stopping"",a nd only then did he do it grudlgingly, and he was apparently going the same way as us as wel!! (He was going to Pasir Ris, we were going to Geylang - its on the fxn way, in the same direction, dude!)

Begging the whole ""Change of shift, must get home to family""  - and ""not going that way"" or just simply speeding away when the fare isnt to their liking is bullshit - oh sorry, not going *your* way? huh? Im not a freakin hitchhiker trying to bum a lift, Im going to pay you for your damn service. 

Nowhere in Singapore is far away. Nowhere is more than an hours drive (and thats going one end to the other!). There is abslutely fkn nowhere that is ""inconvenient"" for the driver to take a passenger.

Nowhere else in the world have I seen this, and damn, I have traveled. As i mentioned, its even actually against the law for taxis to do this in Australia. Ive had better taxi service in run down twenty year old cars in Guatemala than I have had here.

In Singapore, its just not about where you want to go - its about where they want to go, and thats plain bullshit -allowing drivers to do this without repercussion is the mark of a broken system, whereby the public that they are supposed to be servicing is put second to the driver and his convenience and needs.

How often does this happen to you? How do you feel about it? would it be better if laws were put in place to stop taxi drivers doing this? Would it ever happen (doubtful in Sg, in my mind)?

The SG taxi system is utterly broken - discuss.

hvxy96,Guide: Transferring between MRT lines,"So, /u/majoshticbeast recently posted a London underground rendition of our trusty system map, and I noticed that one of the design considerations was to add ""OSI""s onto the map. 

Also, people frequently rant about the DTL loop, not knowing that they can simply tap out and tap back in, and get charged the same fare.

In 2018, in response to the huge loop that the DTL makes, the LTA (finally) decided to allow transfers between MRT lines without needing a bus ride in between, so below are some of what I feel are the most useful MRT line to MRT line interchanges that you can make within the (15min) time limit, and what interchanges to avoid (even though some maps show it as possible) so as not to risk getting charged more for 2 rides.

* Rochor to Jalan Besar

Transferring from DTL2 to DTL3 is one of the biggest timesavers, as it takes at least 15mins to travel that loop on a train. Rochor to Jalan Besar is the nearest 2 stations, which almost guarantees you a transfer within the time limit. Transfers to avoid: Litttle India to Jalan Besar, Rochor to Bencoolen

* Esplanade to City Hall

Easily the most useful travel hack for westerners heading to the sports hub/golden mile, as it avoids the mess that is Dhoby Ghaut. This transfer can actually be accomplished within 5mins when the right path is used (via Raffles City), avoiding the labyrinth of Citylink Mall. Transfers to avoid: Esplanade to Bugis, Bras Basah to Bugis

* Downtown to Marina Bay / Raffles Place

For workers who need to get between the Downtown Line and the NSL/TEL, Downtown is the best station to make the transfer. Typically, Marina Bay is fine for both lines. However if you're using the NSL and it's a hot day you can also opt to use Raffles Place instead as it has an aircon linkway. Transfers to avoid: Chinatown to Raffles Place.

* Dhoby Ghaut to Bencoolen / Little India to Jalan Besar

Both are about the same distance from each other and allow for a seamless transfer between the NEL and DTL. Just reme","[""I'd take the whole DTL loop to avoid the hot sun or (now) the rain :D"", 'My favourite one has to be Bencoolen to Bras Basah.

xmbqmr,The Time I Suspended A Scam Account On Carousell,"Context: I have never used Carousell ever in my life and had zero idea of how this whole transaction thing worked, but I still grant you permission to call me dumb for the first part.

&#x200B;

Ok so I wanted to sell my Switch games on Carousell because I finished it a long time ago and realized I wanted the cash more than the game at this point.

After I had just uploaded the listing, I received a message almost instantly. I know many of you who have more experience with the platform would probably find this extremely fishy, especially since it was 4 am in the middle of the night. But me being new and dumb and money focused, truly believed that it was a legitimate buyer who just REALLY wanted the game that badly.

Anyway, this was how it started:

[ Red flag #1: The first message out of their mouth is to ask for my email address. And that emoji...god how did I fall for such a passive aggressive emoji masking as friendliness.

With me being old, dumb, and broke, I gave my email without a second thought. Also, did I mention I'm dumb?

Anyway, after sending my email over, the scammer then proceeded to tell me to check my email and even my spam folder (nobody would ever say this if they were legit btw, but again, I'm dumb):

11dh21t,Witnessed a traffic accident today and can’t sleep,"Firstly and most importantly, no one died at the scene. This is just a recounting of events that I want to get off my chest. I should be asleep but I can’t seem to.

I alighted at Jln Kayu today about 6pm to walk home and barely 30s later, there were brakes screeching. When I turned back for a look, two people were on the ground, one on the road and another on the grass patch by the sidewalk. A car had hit two pedestrians crossing the road, windshield had a large spiderweb crack, the person on the road (a malay lady) kinda sat up and slowly moved herself to the kerb. The one on the grass wasn’t moving and ngl I feared for the worst until i saw the person stir a bit.

I called 995 after freezing for a bit, tried to give the location of the accident and they sent traffic police and an ambulance. Another uncle closer to the victims was on the phone with either 995 or traffic police too. The lady was still on the kerb, but she had to move as the driver of the car was moving it to a small parking area on the side of the road (traffic only has 1 lane per direction at J. kayu, and other drivers had to drive past in the other lane). 

Another malay auntie and I helped her to the kerb, where she sat/leaned against a fire hydrant. The other person involved was a kid, a young malay boy. I believe he was the one who took the brunt of the impact, considering he was flung onto the grass. The pedestrians nearby came over and soothed him, made sure he didn’t move his head in case of a neck injury. Since there were more than enough people attending to the boy, I went to the lady instead and checked on her. Her lips were very pale and almost white, and she was giddy (probably in shock). I talked to her for a bit and convinced her to sit down on the ground as I was genuinely afraid she would pass out. The same malay auntie who helped earlier came back with a pack of lemon tea for her, which appeared to help.

After the ambulance/traffic police came, the EMTs took the boy to KKH with a","['Have some hot tea and just take a moment of silence to clear your head. \n\nYou did a good thing today.

fycxhb,"Unpopular opinion: The longer we as a nation take to isolate ourselves at home, the longer we will take to recover from COVID-19","**Edit**: The other [frontpage ""unpopular opinion"" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fy8rxp/unpopular_opinion_be_patient_with_other_joggers/) was pretty popular, so I thought maybe the opposite stance would be unpopular, hence the title.

But then again, we have [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fycxhb/unpopular_opinion_the_longer_we_as_a_nation_take/fmzeyce?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) agreeing on how it's okay to still head out because jogging is still legal and also lurkers who don't agree with the outspoken individuals in this sub. 4.9k people online now, but most are lurkers who don't post, this thread is dedicated to them. Unpopular or not? Depends on how you see it.

Yes I get it, cooping ourselves up at home is depressing, suffocating and boring. A small minority of us face legitimate issues such as domestic abuse & mental issues, but for the overwhelming majority the choice between death and boredom should be a simple one (For those who want to argue that it's an exaggeration, please educate yourself with how other badly hit countries are faring). I would say that a majority of us are doing our part by staying at home but it's not enough, everyone has to play a part.

We have to face the facts, COVID-19 isn't going to magically disappear unless we take drastic measures. The only effective way to combat COVID-19 in its accelerating phase is to isolate everyone from each other, it has been proven in Italy and China where their curve is slowly flattening.

11pb5ox,SSDC: A March 2023 guide to getting your Class 3/3A License,"Having recently passed my class 3 license, I found that the SSDC website is trash and does the absolute bare minimum to provide you with the information you need to obtain your license. Sure, there are guides like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/kc7x2n/december_2020_guide_to_getting_a_driving_license/) which are comprehensive, but I want to write something a bit more up to date and also have this guide serve as the guideline for the next year or so before something changes again and someone else comes along to write another guide. Before this, I would like to thank u/espoir90 for providing me with all the minute details that allowed me to get my license seamlessly and without having to rely on differing info from multiple sources.

I first enrolled in early October 2022, took my BTT at the end of the month, started my lessons the very next day. I booked my TP in late Jan 2023, which I took in March 2023 and passed. I completed my FTT and simulator lessons in mid-Nov 2022. The total number of days it took for me from enrolling to actually getting my license was 152 days, with a timespan of 87 days between my first practical lesson and the one that allowed me to book for my TP test.

The process for getting your license goes somewhat like this. I guess this also serves as the TLDR:

1. Enrol online or on-site (walk-in at 9.30am, 2.30pm & 5pm on Weekdays at Level 3)
2. Photo-taking, eyesight test & receiving your training record booklet. If you enrol on-site, this will happen on the same day
3. Watch the online theory videos. Login to your account in order to access it. There are a total of 4 videos. Watch the first 2 to be eligible to book for your Theory Trial Test (TTT) for your Basic Theory Test (BTT). I will explain how the money-sucking TTT system and videos work below.
4. Book BTT
5. Apply for Provisional Driving License (PDL) ($25)
6. Book practical lessons
7. Book TTT for FTT and then book your actual FTT and pass it before your TP test

Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether an update can be provided on the study of fertility leave for public servants; and (b) if such a study has not been conducted, whether the Government will study this proposal.

Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service

We have assessed that there is no need to introduce fertility leave as a separate leave provision at this juncture. Public officers who are undergoing fertility-related procedures can already tap on their current leave provisions, such as outpatient sick leave or hospitalisation leave, or request for flexible work arrangements from their supervisors, such as flexi-time and hybrid work arrangements to undergo or recuperate from the treatment","['Meanwhile in the SAF:\n\nCareer soldier: sir I need time off on Monday\n\nOfficer: give you time off for fkkk?\n\nSoldier: yes sir precisely', ""Lmao from the title i thought fertility leave is apply to go have sex n have babies.\n\nIVF is no joke tho.

zgn014,National Council of Churches statement on 377A repeal,"via their website:

**NCCS Response to the Repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code and the Enactment of Article 156 of the Constitution**

1 The National Council of Churches of Singapore (NCCS) notes the legislative amendments enacted at the Parliamentary sitting on 29 Nov 2022, namely, the repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code and the enactment of Article 156 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.

2 We refer to our earlier statement “Response to Government’s Decision on the Repeal of Section 377A” issued on 21 Aug 2022.

3 The NCCS continues to be concerned about the possible repercussions of the repeal of Section 377A. As highlighted in our earlier statement, we urge the Government to remain watchful on possible moves to restrict the right of religious groups and individuals to “profess, practice and propagate” our religion (to use the language of Article 15 of our Constitution). If necessary, we hope the government would be swift to take legislative and administrative steps to counter these moves and preserve religious liberty as currently practiced in Singapore. In this regard, NCCS appreciates Minister K Shanmugam’s assurance that the law ministry was looking at ways to deal with the harm caused by cancel culture, and Minister Masagos Zulkifli’s assurance of religious freedom for individuals to practise as their own religion states in relation to this issue.

4 With regard to the constitutional amendment to protect the definition of marriage against legal challenge, our preference is for the Government to adopt the more robust safeguard of expressing the current definition of marriage within the Constitution, as recommended in our earlier statement. However, we appreciate and support the enactment of Article 156, which shields the current definition of marriage as that between a man and a woman (and laws and policies formed on this basis) from being struck down by the judiciary on the grounds that they violate the provisions of Part 4 of the Con","["">This part baffles me, though: “we urge the Government to remain watchful on possible moves to restrict the right of religious groups and individuals to “profess, practice and propagate” our religion”\n\nI don't understand this part either.

Look at the recent census from England & Wales where < 40% identify as Christian. They should spend more time convincing their kids not to leave the religion, as opposed to telling people how to live their lives. As it stands, religion isn\'t a compelling way of life to most people who are comfortable and have basic needs fulfilled.  This is like a shepherd trying to butt into the lives of chickens when he can\'t even keep his own sheep from fleeing the pen.\n\nUnfortunately, on a macro/global scale, the world will cleave towards a larger religious vs irreligious divide especially in poor/high birthrate countries (Sub Saharan Africa and Subcontinent) where Islam and Christianity grow by sheer number of babies being popped out of wombs and lack of condom use.', ""Churches are a bunch of Pick Me's fr"", 'Fuck them, fucking bible thumping bigots']"

They openly worship XJP and get deeply emotional when some of his policies are questioned. My dad launches angry tirades about how China needs to invade Taiwan immediately and teach them a lesson for being traitors (""汉奸"") for ""taking Western money"". The rest of them have openly condoned the camps in Xinjiang and XJP crushing Hong Kong's promised autonomy some 20-30 years ahead of schedule. They think these affected regions should be thankful for being given a chance to further develop because Xi's crackdowns created stability and peace. My brother told me that the videos of the war crimes in Ukraine were all staged by the FBI and that the war only hasn't ended because Russia is choosing to take it easy on Ukraine. My sister-in-law openly proclaimed that while she doesn't want war, China has to stand up for herself, and that the very *existence* of Taiwan meant that America is already waging war on Chinese sovereign land (""美国已经打到中国领土上了，我们还不反抗吗""(??)).

I\'ll begin by saying that to me it is quite noticeable how much Singapore has drifted culturally toward China in recent years.  Of course it is much different from my first trips to SG in the early 2000s, but even going back to my first extended stay here starting in 2018, it feels more Sino now than it did - for example, hearing a lot more Mandarin than I ever did before, a lot more Chinese media, just a lot more overt Chinese influence.  I recall that back in 2018 there was an article in the Straits Times about China deliberately trying to convince Singapore it was part of the \'Chinese diaspora\', no doubt with an eye toward influencing future political behavior.  At the time I unofficially spot-polled colleagues, taxi drivers, Grab drivers, etc. to get a feel for how much people agreed with identifying as Chinese, and I would say at the time it was roughly 2/3 ""I am Singaporean"" vs. ""I identify as ethnically Chinese.""

It\'s not easy, especially when it involves very emotional subjects like race and identity. What OP is experiencing has been an increasing occurrence in Singaporean families for some time now, given the increasing number of mixed-national marriages with PRC spouses. The government is not blind to this. During the 2021 National Day Rally, PM Lee explicitly warned in his *Chinese* address that Singaporeans must be aware of the threat of influence from a specific country. No name-drop, but we all know which country lah. Mind you, this was left out in the English and Malay addresses. \n\nImo, the *modus operandi* of the CCP is simple: they don\'t just want to force you to think and behave like them. They want you to *voluntarily* think like them, hold the same beliefs and values willingly. OP, your father is a textbook example of CCP influence operations success, and god-knows how many more have been influenced in Singapore. Unfortunately, this problem is compounded by the sensitive issue of Chinese culture, language and education in Singapore. A lot of older Singaporeans, like OP\'s dad\'s generation, lived through a period of time when Chinese education and culture was sidelined in nation-building efforts. Closure of Nantah and Chinese schools, stamping out dialect use etc. Furthermore, older Chinese Singaporeans are more well-versed in their Chinese history, understanding how China suffered terribly in the past (Opium Wars, Eight-Nation Alliance, European hypercolonisation, Japanese occupation etc.) and has now emerged as a global superpower.

jug1xn,Press Release: A Joint Report on Transgender Issues for SG's 2021 Universal Periodic Review,"I'm one of the co-founders of TransgenderSG, and we submitted our stakeholder report to the UN last month. The full report will be released before the official UPR session next May, but in the meantime this is the press release we put out, which is hopefully useful to those of you who want to know more about issues facing the trans community in Singapore:

--

TransgenderSG and Sayoni have collaborated with the Asia Pacific Transgender Network (APTN) to submit a joint stakeholder report to the United Nations, in preparation for Singapore’s third Universal  Periodic Review (UPR) in 2021.

The UPR consists of an interactive dialogue between the Human Rights Council and member states about steps taken to advance human rights in their respective societies. Civil society organisations are welcome to submit their own information on relevant human rights issues; this information can be referenced by any of the states taking part in the  review.

In previous UPR cycles, Singapore received recommendations to decriminalise sex between men, eliminate media censorship of positive or neutral LGBTI content, and protect LGBTI Singaporeans from  discrimination. These recommendations were all noted by the Singaporean government with no steps taken towards implementation.

This joint submission by TransgenderSG, Sayoni and APTN is the first civil society report from Singapore to focus exclusively on transgender issues. The report references data from the first nationwide survey of Singapore’s transgender community, conducted by TransgenderSG, and a  research study conducted by Sayoni, and addresses the following key  areas of concern:  


1. **The difficult process of legal gender recognition (LGR)**,  including the prohibitive cost of required genital surgeries that can go up to SGD$150k for transgender men; such surgeries being unavailable in Singapore; requiring an invasive genital examination for surgical  confirmation; the significant medical risks of surgery; the lack of MediSa","[""I've got some questions on your points raised. If I can think of these questions, our government can probably think of them too and more, and it'll probably be hard for this to get anywhere if you cannot answer them convincingly.\n\n**Point 1**\n\nWhat are the better ways then to get legal recognition for a person's preferred gender? This is especially important in a country like Singapore where there are significant legal differences between men and women, the main one being NS. If I can change my gender freely without needing any medical procedures, what is stopping me from declaring myself to be female, then changing my gender after NS?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but this point seems to be implying that it is very difficult for someone to get recognised as a different gender in part due to the requirements needed to transition legally (i.e. SRS). You then cite a 9.7% of transgender individuals who have successfully transitioned, but how much of that 9.7% have met the requirement for a legal gender change?\n\n**Point 2**\n\nI don't have much to critique regarding this, but I am curious to know what you mean by students being pressured to drop out.\n\n**Point 3**\n\nLike the first point, I feel like there may be a case of misleading statistics being used here, so perhaps you can clarify. Statistics show that the rate of unemployment in university graduates is about 9.3 per cent within the first 6 months of graduation for the top local unis, but more than 25% from private unis. Your 14.3% does not seem to be significantly different from these.\n\nMy question is whether you have done research on the educational background of the transgender individuals who are unemployed? What is the time period for this statistic? Has statistical analysis been conducted on these results to show a significant difference?\n\n**Point 4**\n\nI would be careful about characterizing the treatment of transgender youths as discrimination. Do you have evidence to show that if a non-transgender youth were to as"", 'honest question: what does ""transgender students"" mean? my gracious take is students who don\'t identify with their gender? im guessing those transgender students started to dress as the sex they identify with to school and got bullied/discriminated as a result.', 'thank you so much for all you have done for the trans community !!', 'Dont know why you got downvoted. I have personal feelings that legal gender recognition should come once one has been undergoing hrt for a certain period of time and/or had some form of irreversible procedure done. Given how ‘what if people abuse the system’ sg is I’d think that is a reasonable thing to ask for. I know some places in the west allow for one to change their legal gender much more easily and while I think that thats a good thing, a concession of what I mentioned above would be great.\n\nSaving for srs is a huge burden honestly , tried to ask if i could get it changed after my orchi but nope. /shrug. We still have a long way to go toward this .', ""LGR is so difficult because of NS. If changing Gender is so easy and doesn't require a physical sex change, there will be abuses and undermine NS.\n\nPerhaps it's good to see what Thailand has done. Thailand has conscription for men too.\n\nSeparately, I can see the point of requiring a physical sex change to be some before changing gender. How would one prove to be of another gender without surgery? Otherwise, we will get confused between gender and sexuality.""]"

Alternatively, if the opposition is that bad, just go with the PAP; that way eventually your opposition party would wither away and die. There is no situation where spoiling your vote sends any kind of signal that you cannot send otherwise.

On one or two (sometimes every three) lane roads, traffic going straight cannot proceed because they are stuck behind vehicles that cannot yet turn left due to pedestrians crossing, and stuck behind vehicles that cannot turn right because of the red right-turn arrow.

I'm all for removing the discretionary right-turns on busy, high-risk junctions but they are also now needlessly installed at quiet junctions resulting in a jam where everyone is stopped for no good reason.

Edit: Thank you all for your discussion. This is my opinion:

1. I'm not against red right-turn arrows. I understand why we need them. But a blanket implementation on even ulu junctions is a knee-jerk reaction which makes for a poorer overall experience.

2. There should always be a dedicated go-straight lane. If conditions do not allow, the right-turning lane should also allow vehicles to go straight so if there are no vehicles waiting to turn right, traffic can flow straight.

3. Why do we not already have smart traffic lights? This will definitely ease the congestion on our roads. Right now, with the same number of vehicles, there are more jams. We are moving backwards.","['blame all the stupid drivers AND motorcyclists for it.

womn38,how do you find confidence in merging with heavy traffic on the expressway,"Hello so i’ve had my license for about 4 years and have only seen heavy traffic on like roads and never really merged into heavy traffic on the highway much. Today i left home late and was really stunned by the heavy traffic when i was trying to merge into ECP that i just kinda stopped there cos there wasn’t a huge like gap to cut into and was also afraid that i’d get hit by like the heavy trucks and cars.

So how do you find confidence in like merging into the heavy traffic? Also kinda tagging on i checked online that I’d get 4 demerit points and a fine, just wanted to know if there’s anything else i should be aware of as the car is registered under my parents. 

TIA!

EDIT: thanks for all the advice! will try to apply them!","[""Don't stop on the expressway, signal and slowly inch in. It's easier for others to know your intent than if you simply stop.\n\nAlso, merge behind heavy vehicles rather than in front of them; they won't necessarily be able to see you due to blind spot and may just pancake your car."", 'keep. moving. \n\nlast thing you want to do is come to a full stop when traffic on the expressway is moving. makes it more difficult for you to find a gap to merge into and for others behind you to do the same. \n\nalso having the confidence to nose in and assert your position helps. but it takes time and experience.', '[deleted]', ""It comes with experience!\n\nInitially when I got my license I was quite intimidated on the expressway as well, especially when there's traffic jams or when lanes are closed for repairs, litter picking etc.\n\nAlways remember to signal your intent early, check your mirrors AND blind spots - eventually you'll find a decent gauge in the mirrors to deem it a safe distance to change lanes.\n\nJiayou! There might be hostile drivers on the roads of course, they can be intimidating at times, but most importantly to stay safe on the roads."", ""If you hesitate, it's usually too late. \n\nThere's a lot of signs to look out for,\n1. Is your entrance to the expressway close to an exit? If yes, then you will most likely have a harder time merging because people are trying to enter and exit the 2 lanes at the same time. For this, usually you keep an eye out for someone trying to exit, and both of you kinda just swap places when either of you gives way. When this happens, you gotta be quick and not hesitate, if not the car behind will take up the empty space. Be sure to look out for cars trying to merge in as well.\n\n2. Make use of the person merging behind you. If the guy behind you finds a space to merge in, be daring and merge in at the same time ahead of him. Most people do not fully accelerate into a merge, which should give you a tiny gap that you can utilize by popping in.\n\n3. Big trucks and old lorries. Be an ass and bully them, just accelerate ahead of them and signal then filter in slowly. I drive both lorry and car occasionally, so when I see a car coming when i am driving the lorry, usually i know they are gonna try and overtake me and merge ahead of me. Lorry drivers are used to it.\n\nIt helps to be as predictable as possible, do not stop suddenly or accelerate suddenly. You want people to know what you are trying to do, so that people can react accordingly. If it isnt raining, roll down your window and put a hand out to say thanks, it makes people more willing to give way."", ""Signal you intention. \n\nSlowly inch in. They'll eventually give way to you.""]"
17stunh,Making sense of Marine Parade MRT station & Underground Shopping Mall,"With the impending opening of the Marien Parade MRT station, I am trying to make sense of some of the designs.

- the station extends all the way to Still Road with what has been announced as ""underground mall"". Aside from the question if this area really needs another mall (i12 is still struggling to find tenants, PP lost its anchor tenant not too long ago, iMall just finished but hasn't opened yet), I am wondering what is the purpose of extending the underground walkway all the way to Still Rd, since this is not a high foot traffic area at all.

- the stretch between Joo Chiat Rd and Still Rd (which is not the actual MRT station) used to be designated as a linear park and had massive trees, it looked fantastic. Now - despite being underground - nearly the entire stretch is taken up by 4 massive buildings as exit/entry to the mall/walkway, there is hardly any space left for greenery. A simple covered walkway would have made so much more sense?

- the station will have an underground bicycle parking space, but there is actually no way to cycle to the station aside from using major roads.

- none of the MRT exits is linked to any of the existing malls, even the MP market is only somewhat oddly connected in front of Parkway Centre.

- side note, anyone knows why they stopped tearing down the MP CC? It's 90% gone but they stopped work some weeks ago

I can't stop thinking that this entire station could have been planned out better and more efficiently.","['> … used to be designated as a linear park and had massive trees, it looked fantastic.

16tafn7,Staying sane when driving (tips and tricks),"Hi all, been driving consistently for 16 years with the last 8+ years as a PHV driver. While I too feel that Singapore drivers are getting less patient, more aggressive and often distracted, driving is still one of my favorite activities and I am here to share some tips for the less happy drivers. 

**Pre-drive routine**: You perceive the world very differently depending on your mood, you create your own reality. Here is my pre-drive routine. After starting the engine, just take 3 slow and deep breaths. Notice what your mood is, how do you feel, remind yourself where you are going and if you are unfamiliar with the route, take the time to go through google map's turn by turn direction. Know that along the way, you WILL encounter kind drivers that you don't notice, as well as assholes that will make their ass-holiness known.

**Game plan**: Have a set of ""mental game plan"" for common situations. What works for me is the following. I will always give way to cars who signal their intentions in advance, I will never tailgate, I will never use my horn in anger or act due to anger, I will always show gratitude to kind drivers by waving or signaling with a quick ""hazard light thanks"", I will never DUI or drive tired, I will never use my phone while driving etc.

**When encountering assholes**: Assholes always seem to pop up suddenly without any warning. Thanks to your pre-drive routine, you would have been more vigilant in expecting them to show up. When I jump scare you at night, you get a rude shock. But if I tell you I will jump scare you when you are otw home later, you might still get shocked but much less right?

First thing is be safe and take immediate defensive actions such as e-braking and creating a larger safety distance etc, basics that you already know from passing TP isn't it.

At the same time, take a deep breath and focus on what you are feeling. Don't judge the situation, it is what it is. That asshole probably didn't wake up in the morning hunting you do","[""Great tips. You can't control how people behave, but you can control how you respond to that. It takes just one asshole to ruin someone's day - don't be that asshole.\n\nDefensive driving, anticipating what could go wrong in any and all road situations, and just try to move past mistakes - the objective is to reach the destination safely in one piece. Easier said than done, but it makes driving a much more pleasurable experience. \n\nPeople are going to do what they wanna do, and sometimes people make mistakes too, we just got to wave it off and move on.\n\nJust get home safely to your loved ones."", ""I want to share mine. \n\n    1. Steer clear of idiots. \n\nSomeone honking you non stop? Tailgating because he wants to pangsai? Swerve in and out like his grandfather's road?\n\nChances are they're idiots. No good will ever come from arguing with idiots, so steer clear of them.\n\n\n    2. Assume all others are idiots.\n\nThey might brake suddenly or cut in without warning. So keep a safe distance. Defensive driving ftw."", ""Hey cool tips. Im a rider on the road, and i appreciate good drivers. Not to discriminate, but i tend to give phv and getgo cars a wider berth and avoid them if necessary.\n\nNot saying they're bad drivers, but sometimes they get complacent or distracted. I know being on the road all the time means they understand the road well, but it also can mean they get tired or get used to driving without being very careful (time is money etc). \n\nSimply said, i treat everyone as an idiot and ride with the mindset to be careful, especially when its a slow moving traffic. I'll watch out for not just signals, but the wheel motion, the swerving, the spaces in between etc."", ""Plan. Your. Lane. Usage.  \n  \nIf you need to make a right turn soon, refrain from taking the left most lane because there is less traffic and think that you can filter in later, then call people assholes for not giving way to you.\n\nIf you are on a dual filter lane and want to get to the right most lane, take the outer filter lane, for the love of God. Don't use the inner lane and expect the guy in the outer lane to give way to you barging into their lane."", 'I refrain from acting on middle finger. But worse case scenario I’ll just thumb down on them.']"
lygvvj,To the man who asked me for money at Bugis Cube,"You came off at the bus stop I was waiting at with a purple shirt. For some reason, you had your stomach exposed because you folded your shirt upward.

But there was more that was exposed, you had dried splotches of blood on your face and plasma peeling from the bridge of your nose. You had a square bandage plastered underneath your mask.

I was pretty sure it wasn’t makeup so I gave you the benefit of the doubt.

You approached me asking for help and you told me you needed money to see a doctor in Lavender.

If I’m being honest, I was pressured to help when you told me about your motorcycle accident a few days ago but, the cynic in me had to fight.

Your speech was a little slow and I had to clarify what you were saying many times because it was too ambiguous.

I asked about which clinic you were going to and I looked it up on my phone. You didn’t even make sure it was the correct one before agreeing along with me.

Still, I couldn’t bring myself to give you money. I offered to take you to the MRT to buy you a ticket to Lavender but you focused on still needing money to see the doctor.

So I offered to bring you to your CC to ask for some help instead. I wasn’t even sure if they provided these kinds of services.

You told me you lived in Jurong West and that the CC said you had to wait two days before any aid could be provided.

I really had no clue what to do. I wanted to be patient and I asked you what you needed from me.

You finally told me you just needed money to see a doctor nearby and I offered to bring you there myself.

After that, there was nothing but an awkward silence and probably a glare I was too preoccupied to notice from my friends trying to tell me that we missed the bus we were supposed to take.

You even said to me that you weren’t a conman.

In the end, you just thanked me but I didn’t really know why when I didn’t help you at all.

You left the bus stop, moving to a crowd of people who just crossed the traffic right.

1713n5j,The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated,"One thing I've noticed with the PR effort, and likely by extension, the policy thinking, around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive. Have you seen the posters? ""Give your car a break - take TEL3"".

Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/Uploads/Investor_Relations/AGM/sbst_agm_minutes_2019.pdf) that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA's ridership estimates of 500k. [That it still produces losses](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/Details/oral-reply-by-acting-minister-for-transport-chee-hong-tat-to-parliamentary-question-on-keeping-public-transport-fares-affordable) in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.

The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.

Consequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.

It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.

Firstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and","[""Some long bus routes are essential to connect residents who don't stay near MRT stations.\n\nFor instance, I stay around Pending area in Bukit Panjang. I can either take an expressway 14 mins bus ride to Stevens to connect to the city, or take a 9 mins trunk bus route to Bukit Panjang station. The expressway bus cuts my travel time by 15 minutes and is far more comfortable.\n\nPlus, some towns like Bukit Merah are far better served by buses than MRT. It just makes more sense for someone going from bukit merah central to chinatown to take a direct bus like 961 than to transfer from feeder bus > red hill > outram park > chinatown"", 'You\'re taking a very Singaporean approach here by only looking at the farebox angle and considering an unfinished line a ""failure"" because it only recovers x cents on the dollar.\n\nFact is, it\'s virtually impossible for public transit to recoup its costs using fares alone.  In monetary terms, the real gains come from opening up land for development: Punggol and Sengkang would be worthless without the NEL.\n\nBut in terms of quality of life, there are still huge efficiency gains to be made by moving people from buses to the MRT: faster, no jams, more predictable, etc.  And that\'s why connecting mature estates like TEL4 will still drive up ridership hugely.\n\nFinally, MRTs don\'t just tap into existing demand, they also induce demand.  I\'m old enough to remember the days when the NEL was often empty and there were white elephant protests at Buangkok, give it another 10-20 years and DTL/TEL will be packed too.  (I have my doubts about CRL, but that\'s another story.)', ""I assume you're suggesting a 2nd round of the [Transitlink Network Integration Exercise between 1991 & 1993](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19901220-1.2.4), which was specifically designed to integrate bus services and improve 1st and last mile connections with the newly opened NSEWL stations at the time.\n\nTo not bore non-bus enthusiasts with too much specific details, as many as 82 bus services were rationalised, and up to 19 new bus services were launched during the Transitlink Integration Exercise.\n\nWhile it is true that the Transitlink Integration Exercise axed many long distance bus routes, it also reinvented numerous long distance bus routes into semi-express routes, such as 30 (by diverting it from Shenton Way to ECP) & 190 (by diverting it from Bt Timah to PIE), which propelled them to their level of popularity today. I believe such reinvention of long distance routes can be explored by LTA as an alternative method to optimise resources, rather than straight up scrapping them.\n\nI can't disagree with you about the peak hour Express & City Direct services, as their demand is indeed not very desirable. LTA should indeed review the viability of some of these services.\n\n51 was actually not a very long route (Eunos - Labrador) back in the 1980s, but SBS thought it'd be a good idea to integrate it with 54 (Hougang - Eunos) & 192 (Jurong - Sth Canal), leading to its current length. I specifically think that 51's integration with 192 was a mistake, and 51 would've been better off terminating at HarbourFront (like 93). 61 & 961 (re-numbered from the former 181) are indeed legacy long distance routes, so TL could've modifed them to more reasonable lengths earlier on in the 1990s.\n\n960 was actually introduced as an integration of the former 182 (W'lands - Shenton Way) & 952 (W'lands - Marina Ctr).

Not only is multiple transiting a major time waster, you have to herd or carry your kids, keep boarding and alighting trains and buses, carry them up and down multiple stairs/escalators/lifts, all just in one trip alone.

In that sense, once the trunk routes have been built, and with LRT lines falling out of fashion, these more marginal TEL and DTL lines become necessary to fulfil that political goal.\n\nI'm encouraged by the thinking of the CRL though, and I think we need more like it. More interchange stations means more journeys can be done faster with fewer transfers, and it also increases system resiliency, so that when one line is knocked out, alternatives exist.\n\nAs for the bus network, as a counterpoint to your thought of shortening bus routes, I think having a mesh of Express busses might actually help alleviate the load on the MRT trunk lines. If you had the choice of a two-transfer crowded rush hour commute on the MRT, or were able to swap that out for a single seat, slightly slower bus journey, you might see people choosing that.

13hz59w,A review of Blackpink’s Singapore Leg of Born Pink,"I want to preface this by saying that I am going to be rather critical. I felt that it didn’t live up to the standards that I would expect from the biggest girl group in the world right now, as well as from veterans that have been in the industry for over 7 years. If you enjoyed it, I’m genuinely happy for you and I do think there are things to enjoy about the concert. So let’s start with the positives:

\-  Girls looked really great. Some outfits I particularly liked were Jisoo’s Flower outfit and Lisa’s outfit for the second act.

\-  Production looked really fantastic. It’s honestly the most beautiful lighting I’ve seen in the National Stadium (props to them for selling it out both nights) especially with the Pink Ocean.

\-  They have some very talented backup dancers and musicians.

\-  Solo stages were really good overall, and I would’ve loved to see more of that creativity in the group performances.

Now on to the gripes I had:

**-  Duration**

o  This is the most common one I’ve heard throughout the tour and for good reason.   Tickets are really expensive – ranging from $190-$400++ (including booking fees). For that price, a 1hr 40 min runtime in total is just pretty underwhelming. This includes the long ass VCRs, performances by the backup dancers and musicians. That’s just really short no matter how you spin it. TWICE for example consistently puts out >3 hour long performances. I’m not expecting that length for all groups but I do expect longer than 2 hours at least.

**-  Crowd interaction**

o  This is a major gripe of mine. The crowd interactions were both brief and few, and basically were just “How’s everyone? I love Singapore food! The weather is hot, I’m so sweaty! Ok our next song is!”. There were zero details or like follow ups about what they liked about Singapore in particular, it was so lazy and just made it feel like they were checking off a box. I think there were like..five short interactions in total? And the last one when Jennie was saying","['I’m sorry but this is basically to be expected from blackpink by now. They’ve been criticised for a very long time for lazy af performances so you’re going to be disappointed if you don’t already expect this.', 'since the start of the tour there were many critiques about their performances and energy levels. i know that they have very little songs for their career but damn, <2hr performance? my exam longer sia', ""Agree with everything you mentioned. I watched them in 2019 at the indoor stadium and they had the same lackluster/lukewarm performance issue, so it can't be the weather's fault. Same short duration, generic greetings and minimal interaction with the crowd and same comment on chilli crab 😂 I would say their energy levels were better in the indoor stadium so I guess the weather got to them.   \n\nOn the flipside, I watched BTS, Coldplay at National stadium and the energy they brought to their entire 3hr concert was palpable, despite them sweating like crazy. Even Robbie Williams at F1 made the crowd go insane in the heavy rain.  \n\nIt's all about professionalism and their relationship with their fans and sadly Blackpink didn't bring their A-game to Singapore... 🥲"", ""Because all of them earn much much more from their luxury brands' endorsements by JUST WEARING their clothes and accessories and carrying their bags."", ""That's unfortunate to hear. Guess I didn't miss out on BP despite enjoying their songs.  \n\nI've only been to IU concerts in SG, but both times she brings her 100% A game plus a lot of fan services (long chats with the audience, interaction, etc) and lengthy encore. Was a well-spent $500 for me both times haha."", ""Liked BP's songs and the individual members, but wasn't a hardcore fan. Not a casual cause I have been following SNSD since 2nd gen.

Hopefully their performance in SG is just as good as I may be tempted to go, but wishing the Blinks had fun and some good memories over the past 2 days."", 'I only casually listen to BP, not their hardcore fan.\n\nBut I have read reviews from people who have attended shows like Music Bank in South Korea, it seems they are known for such performances except Lisa. It seems from their reviews, Lisa always bring her A-game to every stage.', 'Blackpink does music part-time tbh. I have never seen their popularity as a result of their music, though their early discography did win over a lot of people. Their core work of late is promoting brands (Dior, CK, YSL, Celine, Chanel et al). Jennie and Jisoo have acting careers; Lisa had a stint on reality competition shows. I like BP but I don’t think music is their main focus; their albums have always been really short and overproduced, they don’t have much of a say in their music as far as I can tell. So yeah I do feel what you’re saying but BP isn’t known for their ‘passion’ on stage, rather the opposite.', ""Basically, BP performances are crap and their concerts have been lacklustre for years. They're more glorified IG models than kpop idols. \n\nDancing, choreo, and even just simple effort is lacking. Lisa herself said she was the only member that even bothered to practice before performances. You can see it in the way all 4 members are out of sync, making mistakes, and forgetting dances. Respect to Lisa cause she's the only member that looks like she gives a fuck. \n\nBP has an insane amount of casual fans/general public, which is why their YouTube views are insane. But they don't have that many passionate stans, which reflects in their average album sales. They have been underperforming for 2-3 years now, they just have too much clout to actually make a difference.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd highly recommend going for the upcoming TWICE concert in September. They are by far the best stage performers, and give 110% in all their concerts. Tons of fan interactions, concerts can last 3 hours +, even longer if they're in the mood to keep the encore going forever. Their performances also really set the gold standard for k-pop, and their vocal line will belt out high notes for the entire 3 hours without breaking a sweat.\n\nTL:DR, BP has been crap for years.

The lack of promotions, concerts and all those attribute to the lack of quality performances build-up till date.

And that 1h40min duration, it’s consistent with all stops, their discography is just not extensive enough to hold a concert that’s any longer than that.\n\nI hate how they give kpop concerts a bad name because concerts from Suju are incredible good.

The casual fan helps rack the views and streams up but given that Blackpink is their sole point of reference to kpop they will never compare the choreo, fan service etc to the dozens of other groups that do it better, more sincerely and with way more effort and energy. Having said that, catching a major vibe with those other casual fans made the concert fun for me, a huge blink who went by myself. These casual fans I met in the standing pen sang and danced along to every single song and when I asked if I might see any of them in September for Twice they were like nah I only listen to BP.

Also, special mention to Lisa, I'm a Rosie stan but by god Lisa is now the best live performer I've ever seen.

Why is this so normalised? 

We get pissed when ticket scalpers profit a few hundred dollars for buying and reselling tickets. Why aren’t we more pissed when BTO scalpers profit a few hundred thousand dollars by clearly buying a house they weren’t intending to stay in for long, for the main purpose of profiting from it later?

EDIT: to the many commenters saying “don’t hate the players, hate the game”, despite my use of “unparliamentary language” ala “fker”, I admit that that’s the rationale and logical thing to do given the current system. But what I’m emphasizing on is our system is broken and needs to be fixed. And I’m wondering why not more people are angry about this given the recent hooha over coldplay and taylor swift scalpers. Why don’t people say the same thing for scalpers “hate the game not the player”? Why are people lobbying for a change in the way ticketmaster sells tickets but not lobbying for a change in the way the government handles the issue on housing?

130a7fo,TL:DR - Boomer uncle pushed my daughter's stroller aside without asking. Called my wife a f**cking bastard. He made a racist remark as well. I proceeded to confront him.,"Context:

My wife did grocery shopping and brought my 3-year-old daughter along. After which, she went to the coffeeshop nearby to get coffee. Being in the queue with my girl in her stroller, naturally she occupied more space in the queue. The stroller was at her 5 o'clock position.

An uncle joined the queue behind her but for some reason, he pushed the stroller aside. My wife was shocked to see the stroller moving. She looked back only to see the uncle's hand on the handle pushing it away from my wife.

**Wife: ""Why did you push my stroller""**

**Uncle: ""Oh, i want to queue""**

**Wife: ""Ok but why push my stroller? Can't you wait?""**

**Uncle: "" Shut up you fucking bastard""**

I kid you not. My wife just froze and decided not to react and went home and called me. I got furious and immediately left my office and rushed down to confront the MF.

When I confronted him, he said ""nothing wrong with just touching the stroller. Never touch your daughter or wife what"".

I also confirmed that he called my wife a fucking bastard because he confessed to it. His reason as to why he said it was because my wife was rude by asking ""cant you wait?"" Expletives were exchanged.

Out of nowhere, presumably with him not able to say anything else, here comes the xenophobic part:

**Uncle: Shut up you f\*\*king pinoy.**

**Me: WTF, I am Singaporean you f\*\*k.**

**Uncle: You come here take PR, not Singaporean.**

**Me: I was born here, pink IC, i did my NS. I'm Singaporean you dumb f\*\*k.**

Everything is wrong. I would not let anyone push my daughter's stroller without informing me or asking for my permission. Would you?

Are boomers devoid of manners? A simple 'excuse me' would have suffice.

Also, I am a Malay Singaporean, and with so many Filipinos here, a Malay person could be mistaken as a Filipino.

xrsxau,Are Singaporeans generally uncomfortable to do things alone?,"I don't have anything to back my findings aside from mere observations and experience, but it feels like doing things alone for some Singaporeans feels like a massive struggle. 

I know and experience the whole 'secondary school or friends clique must always do things together' but when the time comes where nobody is free, and you gotta do it alone, it can be a fight or flight response because you probably never done it. (Not me per se, but I've seen it from other friends or groups)

Take traveling, dining out, going to a concert alone for example. Hell, watching movies too. But in other countries, people do whatever tf they want. If you go to festivals and concerts overseas, as a single person, you'll find that a lot of people go to these events on their own. No friends, family, nothing. They enjoy it anyhow. 

Partially I think some of these Singaporeans are scared of being judged by others for doing things alone. Newsflash, nobody really cares. Just do it anyway. 

I think being able to enjoy things on your own is a sign of independence and maturity. Your friends won't always be free, but you can still do your own activity. Same for people in relationships.

Is it something ingrained to Singaporeans as a groupthink mentality?","['its really dependent on people about this, some like doing it with friends, some dont, im in somewhat of a similar thing except with the mix of two, sometimes i enjoy being alone since i feel like thats where my quiet time is at and i would hangout or watch movies with my friends also just to keep up with each other', 'Actually bcs alot kaypoh people give u that pity reaction, ""aww you alone? Where you friends?"". Shut up auntie uncles. Diam', 'When I was younger, I needed to do things with another friend. If not, I’m afraid people will think I’m a loser with no friends. \n\nNow that I’m older, I shaved off most of the hi-bye friends, and kept a much smaller friend group. I do enjoy doing things by myself. Shopping by myself is an enjoyment. I can go to any shops I want and just do at my own pace. \n\nI recently watched Dr Strange Movie by myself. I feel that movie is something you can do on your own since you don’t need to talk. My dad felt bad for me and ask me why I watch movie alone lol\n\nI also don’t mind eating alone. Sometimes it’s just me-time.', 'It doesn’t matter whether you talk about Singaporeans or not. It’s really up to an individual and their circumstances. I eat out alone a lot and I’m happily married. If you feel uncomfortable doing things alone but have no choice, just understand that people around you care less about you than you think.', 'I love my friends. I hate group ""outings"". I genuinely don\'t care about doing things alone or with them, it doesn\'t matter to me. There\'s too much ""conflict"" when it comes to groups, even if we love one another, we\'re still different people and if we want different things, I\'m not going to sit there and mindlessly discuss what to do to appease everyone. I\'m an adult, I\'ll just go about my business.\n\nHowever, it seems more likely that this is a person to person thing, and more likely than not we\'re just sheep being herded.', 'I’m 20+ and I’m fine doing all of these alone or with friends, it’s more about when I want to do these activities and who’s available. \n\nI enjoy dining out alone after a long day at work to unwind. And there’s no one to stop me from eating what I’m currently craving!\n\nI enjoy watching movies alone, especially if it’s Marvel so I need to watch it asap before spoilers are out, and when my friends can’t make it for off-peak prices. I’ll choose crowded cinemas so as to enjoy the crowd reactions as well. \n\nI enjoy attending concerts alone if it’s my favourite musicians but not my friends’. Being able to attend a live concert hearing your favourite music is similar to the excitement of hearing it randomly on radio as well.\n\nI tried travelling alone for two weeks recently and omg I would do it again. Bring a people pleaser, it’s sometimes hard to put yourself first. It’s so liberating and I’ve never done so many of my favourite things in a day before. Of course, there are destinations more suitable for solo travellers too. \n\nI think doing things alone boils down to personal preferences. Sometimes I do wonder if people are judging me for eating alone, but I’ll just remove my specs and I don’t see their expressions anymore.', ""The key to true happiness and freedom is to give less fucks about what others think.

18u3drt,AITA for smacking a strangers hand as they went to touch my baby's face?,"30M here with a 9 month old son, we find that it is a rather common occurance that as we bring our son out for walks that many elderly folk would want to touch his hands and face. Usually with relatives, we don't really have a problem with it, and we ask them to wash their hands before doing so. But random strangers touching our son is a little uncomfortable.

So afew days ago, as we brought our son out to NTUC, A random uncle just reached out to touch my son's face without any warning. My dad instincts kicked in and I smacked the uncles hand away from my son with a decent amount of force. Said uncle was rather shocked and walked away glaring at me. 

My wife stands by that I did the right thing and we are rather concerned with the spike in covid cases, we do not wish for unnecessary risk of exposure to any viruses or bacteria. But when we told this story to her parents, they claimed that I went too far and the uncle was simply showing affection.

xgdfaf,A dude was masturbating beside me at Male Urinals. Feeling traumatised. Seeking advice,"Male 28 here. This happened at lvl2 West Gate toilet. Something very uncomfortable just happened to me.

As I was doing my business, I could see from the corner of my eye that he was masturbating and looking my way. I quickly finished up and walked out of the toilet fast.

1asby2q,GetGo: Why YOU shouldn't.,"Over the past 2 months, I have started using GetGo to run errands as my car's COE expired. This is my experience.

Since opening my account in Jan 2024, I have made a total of 15 bookings. Of which, 2 of them have been cancelled for cockroach infestation, 5 cars I rented either had flashing engine lights or some sort of malfunction. 

Of the 5 that had issues, 1 of them left me stranded along TPE on the first day of CNY. I had elderly grandparents with me that day, and after contacting GetGo, they ONLY offered a replacement vehicle (which i had to walk 5km for) and a $20 discount for future bookings.

GetGo's fleet, especially its older ones (Mazda 3, Ssangyong Tivoli) are absolutely horrible. I honestly doubt they maintain their vehicles.

To all new drivers or those who intend to use carsharing, PLEASE THINK TWICE. With their insanely high insurance excess and poorly maintained vehicles they're just counting on you to screw up.

If you still decide to use carsharing, pleasepleaseplease check and make sure the car is safe to drive. If at any point you feel uncomfortable with the car, call them to cancel it. Whatever you intend to do with the car is not worth the $10k excess you pay if things go bad.","['Their Mazdas, Vezel and Ssangyong are terrible I got to say.

it would be nice to hear other people’s personal stories too, so i wont feel so alone. 

one of it was that some guy insisted to get into a r/s with me after meeting me 2/3 times. he was q touchy too. i felt so stupid for meeting him the 3rd time or so. i also specifically said that idw to get into a r/s. i just wanted to b friends. the guy was q manipulative too, i only realised that after cutting him off. i felt q dirty.

one other experience was that i met up with this other guy and it was to make friends, to get to know one another. he knows that too. it was the first time meeting him, and he was rlly touchy. i felt so uncomfortable.. like i am not even touchy with girls when i meet them for the first time.. personal boundaries right?

Half of movie, he put his hand on my thigh covered skirt. I pushed his hand away softly. Seconds later he put it there again, squeezed my right thigh and started hiking up my skirt. Stopped his hand by squeezing it and told him ""no""  quietly. My heart was beating like crazy. I was scared shitless, I did NOT want him to touch me. He said ""it\'s okay. Just a bit. It\'s hot"". I tried to lift his hand again and said ""No"". He tried to kiss my neck while still hiking up my skirt, I said again louder ""NO!"" and that got through him.

dz2yyw,Incels in Singapore,"I’ve seen quite a rise in incel ideology recently. While I do acknowledge that it has already been there for quite a while I think it has been especially prevalent as of late.


I saw a [post](https://incels.co/threads/singapore-an-incel-nation-and-cuck-capital.158958/) on an incel forum that I browse occasionally. While I am not an incel myself, I do enjoy listening to their rants as I can relate to some of their rhetoric.  What made me uncomfortable about this post was that the OP was a fellow Singaporean with his pic set to a gif of the Elliot Rodgers. ( An incel who killed 6 people in the US )


But after stumbling upon this post I realised that there is quite a community of incels in Singapore - I have a few friends who are like this as well. And I do think that a discussion needs to be started on this before this ideology goes too far.

If a girl leaves her boyfriend because she has found another guy with earns more, it becomes ""all girls are superficial and money-minded"" or ""all girls are selfish and heartless bitches"". Same goes for girls who say ""all guys think with their d\\*cks"".  Incels see gender first and ignore the person behind the gender. It\'s no different from racists who see the colour of your skin first and decide what you\'re like before getting to know you as a person.\n\nSecondly, incels think about getting a girl first and hunting for someone (anyone!) to fill in that category. If someone approaches you with the intention of wanting to get something from you, of course you would avoid that person. You would cut off that friend who bugs you to join his MLM or harasses you to buy his insurance policies right? Because they just see you as a money bag. Even if an incel manages to lure a girl in with ""you\'re so pretty, you\'re my dream girl etc etc"", it\'s a relationship that\'s never going to last because it wasn\'t based on anything concrete like shared values.', 'How can you be an incel here when you can go siam diu with all that money', 'Just some comments after reading the whole thread.\n\nFor context, I was incel in my youth (before the incel term was even invented) but later wised up, married and now family man with children.\n\nHonestly, finding a girlfriend is not that difficult if you are willing to put in some effort and change mindset a little. \n\nThe hard non-sjw truth about women is that they want to feel secure. Forget all the female empowerment bs. At a very primal, instinctive level, women all want a partner that makes them feel safe. This is why you hear requirements like ""must be xxx cm or taller"" or ""must earn $xxxx and above"". It\'s not that the lady is shallow / materialistic but rather these are some quantifiable factors they use to define security (whether these are accurate indicators is another matter). \n\nSome things that can help would include:\n\nPersonal grooming. Get some nice clothes, nice hair cut, make sure you don\'t stink, walk with a straight back etc\n\nLearn how to hold a conversation. Read some proper books, watch educational shows, keep up with the news, follow some trends that ladies do, know how to crack jokes...\n\nPortray confidence, drive, initiative. If you feel sad because you are bbfa in a low paying job, find something to boost your self esteem. Go workout, exercise, have a plan to improve the job predicament you are currently in...\n\nSet realistic expectations. Ultra chio bus will have lots of suitors so if you are incel to begin with, your chances of getting one as GF is very slim. Looks wise, I feel a decent looking one is good enough. It\'s more important to find one of good character. Observe how she treats her family, friends, lifestyle choices etc...\n\nAnyway the most important thing for incels is to keep trying.

17qk2n0,In response to a recent r/singapore post on how to increase ridership for new rail lines...,"A while back on the more public transport-related side of r/singapore there has been one post in particular generating quite some buzz due to its highly controversial message. Unfortunately it came at a time when I was particularly committed elsewhere, hence this very late posting (the original post was published on 6th October 2023).

[Link to original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/?share_id=e4osWcyr4HfMJLVRQAc5q&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=3)

Nonetheless it contains much dangerous confusion in public transport discourse locally which we should be aware of and steer clear from. I am in no way implying the author (or OP as I will refer to) is out with any malicious agenda, but it is good to be aware of unhelpful thinking that doesn't improve public transport, and avoid it actively.

To tl;dr the long 990-word essay that OP has typed up, he wonders why the TEL (and DTL), despite operating in revenue service its third stage already and currently serving the CBD, is still not ""performing as well"" as expected. There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form ""sucks"" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it's the case and suggest possible remedies. Unfortunately, this complex line of reasoning is riddled with fatally inaccurate assumptions, shaky logic, and prioritising the wrong things, which was why the long scholarly-appearing piece came off as offensive to many common folk who actually experience the system on a daily basis, and more critically ***rely*** on it in their lives.

The entire issue of underperforming rail lines, while a factual reality, has been framed entirely wrongly by OP, from the very start of the piece.

The original post, which is quite lengthy, questions the performance of certain rail lines, especially the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), and suggests that they are underperforming financially. The author argues that public transport should be viewed through a broader lens, focusing on its social and economic benefits rather than just profits.\n\nThe post highlights that the TEL serves lower-density areas, and the key to increasing ridership is to improve service quality. The author suggests that diverting bus routes to support the TEL may not be effective and criticizes the idea of forcing people onto trains. The argument is made that buses can be efficient and reliable if they are given the appropriate priority.\n\nThe author also questions the effectiveness of a hub-and-spoke model for public transport and points out that it may lead to inefficiencies and inconvenience for passengers. The post argues that the focus should be on providing high-quality service to attract more riders, rather than reducing bus services.The post criticizes the use of an example from Ottawa to support the idea of reducing bus services, as Ottawa's approach has not been successful. It also highlights that increasing service quality and reducing traffic congestion can bring substantial economic benefits.\n\nIn summary, the Reddit post criticizes the original message for focusing on profits and suggests that the key to improving public transport in Singapore is to prioritize service quality and efficiency, rather than cutting bus services. It argues that reducing traffic congestion and providing better service can lead to significant economic benefits.  \n\n\nalso wanna point out OP you say the other post is long but yours is 3431 words bro... more than 3x the original"", ""I agree that the original post from OOP was unnecessarily complicated and used some questionable examples to support what seems to me a relatively simple main premise: Singapore should do more to proactively rework its bus network in order to better support ridership on new MRT lines and to maximize the advantage of each mode of transport. \n\nHowever I think that the better approach to critique that article was to suggest better ways of supporting that premise, rather than spend paragraphs after paragraphs knocking down the relatively weak examples used.

It’s dishonest to argue that OP is only solely focused on profit when they clearly are focused on efficient allocation of a public good.\n\nAs an analogy, we don’t measure the quality of schools by how much revenue it collects. However, revenues are a good proxy to how many students attend that school. If we built a school that served only 10 students but has 6 storeys and 30 classrooms, then surely we have clearly misallocated the public good.\n\nIf you don’t like the framing with profit and revenue, then the same question can be asked without those terms: could these stations and lines have been built elsewhere where ridership would have been greater and served more people?\n\nThe original sin of DTL and TEL lines is that their stations are built in perplexing locations with low density.', 'This post seems like nothing more than an attack on the OP.

p64rcw,My Driving Experience at CDC(Comfort DelGro),"hi! i just decided to write this short post since i have some free time on my hands haha. 

my driving journey was at CDC ubi and it lasted around five months. here's the breakdown and tips:

&#x200B;

Early Nov 2020 -> start reading up details on the driving centers websites(CDC, BBDC, SSDCL) and choose the center you want:

\- different centers are at different locations with differences in pricings! for example, CDC has a few pick-up points where you can attend your lessons at but you'll have to pay an extra fee(around $9) for each practical lesson.

\- keep in mind the diffs in miscellaneous fees too

&#x200B;

Late Nov 2020 -> enrolled online at the CDC website:

\- be sure to select the correct class (eg 3A auto) and definitely confirm if you're signing up under school or private.

\- i accidentally signed up as a private student and i had to email CDC to close my old account and i had to open a new account under school learner afterwards. it isn't possible to switch between school and private learner so easily, and you'll need to wait a while to get a refund too(if you want to switch tracks).

\- sign up EARLY at the website because there's a lot of waiting time needed(i enrolled in late nov but the earliest date i could select for my eyesight test was late dec)

&#x200B;

Late Dec 2020 -> go for the eyesight test appointment:

\- you'll need to make an appointment in advance for this(like i said earlier), they didn't accept walk-ins 

\- they'll ask you to look into a lens and read out a few letters

\- the counter staff will give you the learner's booklet and simulator course pamphlet!

\- you can book the simulator course after 5 practical lessons only

\- but you can book your internal evaluation (for basic theory test BTT) 

\- you can also book optional theory classes for BTT(that will have a separate cost!)

\- you can book the induction program also

&#x200B;

Jan 2021 -> go for induction program 

\- basically an orientation of the car blinkers, sign","['On a semi related note: those looking for private instructors, do consider signing up for school instead. From what I know right now, private usually costs around 1-1.5k (depending on how fast you pick up driving). School costs around 1.7 - 2.2k. If you go ahead with private and get an impatient instructor, you may end up spending the same amt as school if you need to retake your TP test multiple times.\n\nI broke down the costs and wrote a summary of the whole license obtaining process [here](https://josephdev.medium.com/getting-a-driving-license-in-singapore-cdc-2021-502eabfc6da0), feel free to take a look.', '**Don’t underestimate the importance of getting a good instructor if you plan on going private!** My first instructor was constantly angry and barely could speak english or chinese.

kc7x2n,December 2020 Guide to Getting A Driving License at SSDC," 

When I was researching online about how my driving journey for class 3 license as a school student would be, I discovered that while there were a lot of tips scattered here and there, cohesive guides were rare and outdated with varying degrees. There were even fewer regarding SSDC, which is more ulu than the 2 other driving centers. Thus, I promised myself to the higher powers in the world that when I pass the test, I will give back to society and write an updated guide as of December 2020 about what is the current situation like. Three things to note: First, there were still many changes and updates even during my 3.5 months journey the driving school, and you should expect many more to come. Secondly, this is after COVID circuit breaker era, so to the future you who are reading this, hopefully, the pandemic is over and there may be changes, but changes in this aspect should be unimportant. The third thing, I have coordination issues, which made my driving journey a lot more difficult, just a little something to take into consideration when listening to my story. Heads up, getting a license in Singapore is filled with LOTS OF hassle, so be prepared. Without further ado, let’s start! 

The first hurdle you need to clear is to register an account and pass your BTT. Their steps overlap so I will explain them together. What do you need to start an account? Paylah and at least $2K (Ok, you don’t technically need so much cash to start the account, but it’s important to have, explain later). Go to the SSDC website, register an account online. You will pay a lump sum for all the miscellaneous things, which includes the eye test and the BTT & FTT theory book (so don’t buy!). I always paid using Paylah. You have an account now, good. It’s a bit confusing hereon. I will list the steps before I explain why.

&#x200B;

* Register and pay for the account
* Watch all the BTT theory videos online.
* Go to SSDC for the eye test, photo-taking, take the BTT&FTT theory books, and g",[]
p9r3cj,How false accusations mess things up for EVERYONE.,"I really wanted to get this off my chest after seeing the recent report on the [doctor recently acquitted of sexual violence](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-mount-elizabeth-molest-acquitted-yeo-sow-nam-2115606) after the accuser confessed to lying and providing misinformation in court. This is to address some responses out there that want to highlight how this is supposedly 'feminism' creating harm towards men.

As a man advocating for gender equality, has studied gender theory, and subscribes to feminist ideas, let me clear the air and say that **THIS. IS. NOT. FEMINISM.** What the accuser did, *if^1* she willingly lied to the police, courts and everyone for the sake of personal vindication, might be the most anti-feminist bullshit one can pull.

She abused gendered divisions of power to not just harm the man in this case, but to create insecurity among other men AND, most crucially, **impacted REAL survivors of sexual violence of all genders**. This will also cover other instances of sexual violence (probably).

*****
**The harm she causes**

Okay first, the elephant in the room, and the discourse I see literally everywhere: ""False accusers harm men, thus we must stop them, because it's a BIG problem."". No shit, falsely accusing someone of a crime in a heavily retributive justice system based on punishment and a media environment that is highly vigilantic is obviously going to be a major issue for the person accused. But, as big of a problem as it is in this perspective, why are you going after *everyone* who may be falsely accusing? Ask yourself about wider systems at large. Did the court need to release the accused's name? Did the media **have** to dart straight to the doctor's employer before any judgement was given? Did the media need to put their name out for trial before any verdict was given? Why is the justice system set up to serve punishment and violence, which can enable false accusations even more? What does this say about our society","['Charge the false accused, publish her name. Doesn’t matter what gender falsely accuses, they should be thoroughly punished. Mental illness or whatever you’re going through doesn’t give you a free pass to screw up someone else’s life. That doctor suffered 4 years.', ""Can't we just not report the names until the person has actually been convicted?"", ""Trust but verify, listen to both sides, let the verdict be premised on evidence and not emotion. Importantly, the presumption of innocence must be observed unless proven otherwise.\n\nIn the age of social media and communication, an acquittal alone is not adequate to relief the falsely accused of the implications that false allegations bring about. His name will forever be etched on the internet. Aside from mental and financial drain, clientele and friends have been lost, trust eroded. Gossips will still go on even after the verdict. As much as it is unfair, if two candidates are equally competent, companies will tend to gravitate towards one with a clean background rather than one with an acquittal record.\n\nIMO, all names should be redacted unless a conviction is reached. At the very least, this should be accorded to defendants of severe offences, or offences that have the propensity to invite wide outrage. \n\nRegarding the second proposal, some people may find it unjust to grant anonymity to some defendants but not others. However, such misalignments are already in force. Young defendants are automatically granted gag orders, so are women who are on prostitution charges. \n\nI suppose one reason for this is to protect such persons whom are deemed vulnerable, and this measure is to shield them from repercussions that may disproportionately affect them.\n\nBut then take this case in question. Who are we to say that this honourable doctor is not sufficiently affected to warrant the same protection?

This is something that needs to be addressed as a society rather than just going against champions of equality. Equal treatment of all genders, and this means helping to do away with patriarchal norms, toxic masculinity and oppression across all sexes.\n\nI remember one particular documentary on CNA in particular when the OP brings up this issue. It was trying to highlight domestic violence against men. And how society cannot accept men reporting domestic violence across both camps. Females victim-shame the victims and males emasculate the victims without empathy. Victims become pariahs with no refuge. Now this is what we need to fix, with rising equality we cannot simply ignore needs because they don't fit gender norms. How can we have equality when it's coded in our legal system when men can only legally be sexually abused or raped by other men and not women unless they are a minor. These are just a small facet of the bigger issues.\n\nTo be 100% clear, I've been touched inappropriately openly in front of others by female students and gay male students when I was studying in poly without my consent. But as a male, when I told them to stop everyone literally laughed it off and continued harassing me openly in public with no recourse because it's publicly acceptable. This happened constantly over 3 years I was there and it still sends chills down my spine that society today believes it's acceptable behavior."", 'Until the penal code is amended to include WOMEN as able to rape MEN, this issue will continue to be a gendered issue no matter how you spin this.', '[deleted]', 'Saying false accusations are rare implicitly downplays the severity of actual false allegations and the impact it has. So what if it is rare? Is it not important to have a national discussion about this matter and seek to find ways in which we could bring about a better or more positive outcome?\n\nYou know what? The majority of men don’t commit any sexual violence in their entire lifetime either. It is **rare** to find a random male individual who is actually a sexual offender. But we don’t go around parading this fact and pretend that women who are victims of sexual violence shouldn’t be afraid or worried just because the next male they meet would likely not be a sexual offender in terms of probability.\n\nWe can believe sexual violence survivors without having to downplay the distress caused to men who are wrongly accused of sexual assault. Both are terrible and both deserve a national conversation of their own, at their own time. \n\nWomen are no less the oppressors than man are the oppressors, whether in terms of sexual violence or false allegations. So why is it every time when cases of sexual violence involving women come up we say “we need to fight against the patriarchal systems and toxic masculinity”; and yet when things like this come up you say “it’s a false equivalence to even suggest there might be something wrong in the dynamics between female and males with regards to sexual violence allegations”?', 'Just answer me this. Punish the accuser for false accusations or not?', 'Why must we believe the “victims” and not the “accused” without any evidence? By saying that you already have a bias in your judgement. I will never believe anything without concrete evidence. It is so easy to accuse people of anything nowadays.', 'I am disinclined to get into a prolonged discussion on this, because the obvious truth is that everybody is deliberately talking past everybody else. \n\nI just have a few points to raise for your consideration. \n\nA) Let me start with the emotional stab, right where it\'ll bloody hurt. Based on MHA statistics (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/about-40-per-cent-of-sexual-assault-cases-from-2017-to-2019-involved-victims - secondary source reporting, YMMV) the total number of sexual assault complaints reported from 2017 to 2019 is 6988, of which 1368 prosecutions were proceeded and 931 convictions obtained. \n\nEven if one takes the most liberal interpretation of these statistics and assume that each of the 6988 cases involve different victims (because, as Min Shan noted, ""the number of victims does not tally with the number of cases, as a case could involve more than one victim, or a victim could be involved in more than one case""), that means that over the course of 3 years, a total of 6988 women were sexual assault victims (deliberate word choice, even though the more precise word, if we want to be honest about it, would be ""complainant""). \n\nThe ratio of men to women resident population over 2017 to 2019 has stayed relatively constant at around 49:51 (source: SingStats). Meaning that the women resident population is approximately half of 5.65m - roughly 2.83m. \n\nThe percentage of sexual assault victims over the three years across the resident population is therefore 0.24%. \n\nNow there are, of course, issues with how I reached that number, but the point I want to make is that as small and statistically insignificant 0.24% is, *no one would ever say that sexual assaults are rare and use that to handwave concerns away*. \n\nSo why the continued banging on the drum that false accusations are rare? Is this trying to reframe the issue into a debate over the definition of what is ""rare""? Is that even a fruitful discussion to begin with? Should the principle be,', 'Rare doesn’t mean unimportant. To use a current example, mRNA vaccine related anaphylaxis and myo-/peri-cariditis are exceedingly rare.

Examples such as these are the epitome of irony, and betray the fundamental reason of why we even have laws, judges and courts. Any harm done to an innocent by the justice system is particularly egregious. People are right to be angry.\n\n“Believe” is not an objective term. The police owe no duty to believe anyone. Their duty is investigate any complaints without fear or favour. To establish facts and hopefully arrive at the truth.\n\nThere is zero necessity to “believe” anyone in doing this.

Another person I know was accused of molesting a girl until a condo security camera video helped exonerate him. He went through hell for a couple years and had to pay legal fees. Are you saying, OP, that he doesn’t deserve to be able to countersue?\n\nAnd why are you assuming that gendered violence is what’s going to happen as a reaction?

Period.', 'GTFO with the ""b-b-but false accusations ArE rArE"" bullshit. What\'s the point in that? Kidnappings and murders are rare too, but does one say that when talking about these cases?

Thank you all for reading my story and emphasizing with me.

I had my worst service and overall experience with Lim Ah Boy workshop. I would like to write this review to warn others of the high cost of repair and their poor services so that you don't need to go through the mental stress that I went through just to get my bike fixed. I rarely write bad review about a place unless it is so bad but for this, I want to give 0 star if it is possible. It is hands down the worst service shop I have been to in Singapore.

The technician quoted me SGD $1200. Their justification was on the engine cylinder head, engine block, gaskets, and coolant tank fan. I will explain more in my message below. I merely went there for a coolant issue, and this was the price I received.

My bike had a high engine oil temperature alarm, and I googled for the nearest workshop from where I was then. It was nearby Lim Ah Boy, so I went ahead to them to get my bike alarm looked at. Prior to going to Lim Ah Boy, I searched about them online and found that they are popular in Singapore, and they have a strong social media presence. This made me trust their workshop instead of going to my usual workshop near my house as I did not want to overheat my bike further.

When I reach their shop, I bought a $20 dollar coolant and was instructed to ride over to their workshop which was slightly away from their main selling shop. I rode over and I was rudely told off to wait outside the workshop and they will attend to my bike. I am okay with waiting however at least say nicely and ask me what am I am here for? not chase me out as I am a customer too.

After around 30mins, my bike was finally attended, and they refill the coolant. I t","['Ah Beng style scam and inconvenience you then pressure you into their demands.

ocpmau,Why are NTU students so outraged/pissy/strawberry/entitled?,"The purpose of this thread is to inform non-NTU undergraduates about what our undergraduate experience is like on a daily basis, to help them to understand why many are unhappy with the NTU administration. You may or may not agree on some of the points I will be making below, but do keep in mind that these are real stories and experiences of NTU undergraduates that I've experienced, or have read/heard about from other undergraduates through word of mouth or through online posts.

&#x200B;

The NTU administration has had a reputation amongst students for neglecting undergraduate welfare and experience, even alumni who have graduated in the past can attest to it. The only semblance of welfare we receive is the occasional '10 tips and tricks to deal with covid stress' emails. Whenever students bring up an issue, the response would to outright ignore it, or if you are lucky enough to receive a tone-deaf corporate response with blanket statements without elaborations. I guess that for many students, the biggest gripe we have about the administration is their *inability to provide timely, meaningful and actionable communication.*

Glaring issues that have been a mainstay in NTU for decades are still in full play today, and I will elaborate on them below in no particular order.

**Shuttle bus services**

*To address the 'it's a privilege not an entitlement' crowd, take a look at this* [*corporate magazine published by NTU*](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/default-source/corporate-ntu/isu/ntuataglance2020678c7c5eca2b4b218ad04c69365b9e3f)*, aimed at attracting potential undergraduates.* It clearly advertises 'Internal shuttle bus services' as one of the various student services. Shuttle bus services are an entitlement to undergraduates, and the cost of running such services are included in our fees.

Alumni who have graduated over a decade ago can attest to the fact that our campus shuttle buses are inefficient, irregular and underregulated. The number of campus buses are in sho","['Alumni here. Can vouch on the ""money/ranking/reputation first, students last"" sentiment.', 'I think its great that you guys are pushing back. As an alumni of both NUS and NTU, I think the main problem with our universities is the **bloated administration**. Here is an interesting factoid. Over the past 10 years, the number of undergraduates in NUS and NTU has risen  quite steadily. You would think that the number of faculty ought to rise in tandem right? Nope. The number of teaching faculty members have actually decreased! You can see this phenomenon across all the local universities. Its a blatant bloated bureaucratisation of the university at the expense of teaching quality. \n\nNUS undergraduate enrolment 2010: 24,785.  \nNUS undergraduate enrolment 2020: 29,510.  \nNUS faculty 2010: 2,609  \nNUS faculty 2020: 2,559  \nNUS ""executive & professional"" staff 2010: **2,084**  \nNUS ""executive & professional"" staff 2020: **3,741**\n\nWhat has increased? Their so-called ""executive & professional"" staff increase by a whopping 70% while number of faculty reduced and number of students went up.\n\nSource: [https://www.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/annual-report/nus-annualreport-2011.pdf](https://www.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/annual-report/nus-annualreport-2011.pdf)\n\n[https://www.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/annual-report/nus-annualreport-2020.pdf?t=NUS\\_AR\\_201007](https://www.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/annual-report/nus-annualreport-2020.pdf?t=NUS_AR_201007)', 'Regarding module registration, as a student in NUS, our ModReg system (or the older CORS) isn’t perfect, we still face issues like biz students selecting all modules and dropping the ones they don’t want at the last minute while others can’t get those modules. However, I was absolutely horrified when I learnt NTU operated their module exercises on a first-come-first-serve basis. It’s incredible that the school still clings on to this format.', '[deleted]', 'With regards to the NTU shuttle buses, I get the impression that the university management as a whole does not treat them with enough importance to run the services in a coherent manner. It appears that the management is happy to let students rely on the SBS Transit buses 179 and 199 plying through the campus, and the internal shuttle is mostly an afterthought.\n\nA key problem I have with the system is that **none** of the routes have a proper terminal to start and end. The closest you all have to a terminal is a haphazardly paved patch of land near the Graduate Halls where the buses park. This ""terminal"" is located not quite along the route but in between bus stops, so buses have to end at Saraca (Blue) or Hall 10 (Red) while starting from Opp Hall 10 (Blue) or the Grad Halls (Red).\n\nHowever, the route doesn\'t have a formalised start or end, so the bus drivers have to exit the ""carpark"", drive multiple rounds (up to three!) before terminating, to ensure that there is service across that gap. Anyone who understands bus bunching can tell you that having each trip be three rounds long will cause the buses to bunch up and the timings to be terribly irregular. The driver cannot guarantee that each of the three rounds will take the same time to complete! In contrast, at NUS where I\'m based, the buses travel one round maximum and layover at a terminal that is along the route. So the departure times at the start of the route are always guaranteed to be regular - if a driver is fast and early, the break ensures he departs the terminal on time instead of too early, while if he is delayed along the way, he can speed up to reach, and subsequently depart, the terminal on time instead of late. Not to mention that if the drivers get more breaks, they\'ll have an easier life and hopefully drive safer.\n\nThe timings are also not coordinated, and appear to be based on when the drivers need to change shifts to drive for other contracts outside campus, so I\'ve encountered the situation w', ""As an incoming NTU freshman who's about to start school in a month, honestly this is quite alarming to read. I wish I had researched more about how messed up the school administration is before accepting NTU's offer back then.

The crappy on-campus shuttle service is also due to the unwillingness to pay a bit more to the contractors.\n\n> Lack of quality education\n\nThis is the issue of how NTU positions itself. Since university ranking does not look at teaching, it just gets ignored. Faculty members are also under the stress that the university tries to squeeze every bit of 'utility' out of them with an emphasis on research. In my view, this is unnecessary and not a sustainable way to retain the faculty members as it creates a vicious cycle: \n\npeople left -> higher cost to hire people (need to pay higher salary) -> more extraction from the new hires -> new hires left\n\nEdit: added the second part of the comment on education quality"", '[deleted]', 'Just to add on, at the start of Covid pandemic, the govt announced that WFH should be default.

But NTU still continues to hold finals onsite with hundreds of students in the examination halls under the same ventilation system, which was the prime suspect of Covid outbreak at TTSH!

I’m not sure if the administration even knows this or just assumes every student has to deal with data in their projects. Even in the template and guidelines they give us, it’s obviously skewed to the sciences. Aim of study, methodology, results and impacts - these are not how a humanities paper is written. Even our profs (loveliest faculty members ever) are aware of this and are resigned to us having to skew our papers to fit ureca’s requirement. Also, it’s a known fact that it’s much harder for humanities fac to get research grants/tenure, which is honestly a wasted opp because any one of us will tell you that our profs are really passionate and genuinely want the students to do well (which is why I was surprised when I heard about fac from other schools just plonking theory on their slides and reading off of it during lecture). Humanities profs are ones that really care about student wellbeing, they go out of their way to find us opportunities when they hear about our concerns, or if they know that a student needs help say, finding a job etc. I honestly find the lack of support for the humanities disappointing but I guess it’s also the same in other countries where the arts and humanities are seen as non essential and disposable.', 'NUS student here who did local exchange in NTU. \n\nI was really shocked at how the modules are taught in NTU. I took an EEE machine learning module, but all we got from the prof was a big bunch of messy slides of pure theory, and he would simply read through them during lecture. And the prof uploaded his slides (about 50-100 slides per chapter), in a format where we couldn’t use Ctrl-F function (????). I have no idea why that restriction was there in the first place. I had to email in to request for the slides to be uploaded in a Ctrl-F-able format. The worst part was that the quizzes and final exam were based on memorising content. There was no coding involved in the entire module.\n\nI took an MS module that was based on pure memorisation as well. The worst part was that there were past year papers available in the printing shop. All we had to do was memorise the answer keys because there was a very obvious pattern of repeated questions throughout the years. I learnt nothing from this module. \n\nBack in NUS, all of my exams for my engineering modules at least included a one A4 sized cheatsheet. The exams consisted of application questions instead of definition questions.\n\nI spoke with other people that took these NTU modules with me, and all agreed that they sucked.\n\nApparently this is the norm for engineering students (memorising content for assessments)?

oa2cts,Share your driving school/ instructor experiences,"Hi r/singapore, I have just gotten my license and am really curious to know more about your experiences with getting a driving license in Singapore, because I know that many/most experiences are quite bad. I took my test at SSDC with a private instructor, and here are some of my experiences with him. 

To provide background, he was recommended by a friend, and his website looked quite legit and had driving 'keywords' in the url (**pass driving** in **sg**) so I guess he was not bad at search engine optimization, so I went ahead and hired him. 

1. On my 2nd lesson, he spent much of the time talking loudly on the phone with his lawyer about his divorce. I didn't mind the distraction, but shortly after he had to pick up his daughter from school and repeatedly demanded me to speed up to up to 60km/h even though I have barely learnt the basic maneuvers of a car. Once he got to a suitable place for him to get his daughter, he dropped me off in the middle of a road in Ang Mo Kio instead of the agreed pick-up point at Yio Chu Kang MRT more than 15 minutes early of the 90 minute lesson. 

2. The instructions he gave were vague, and I had to infer what he meant or derive the correct method from which technique you were using when you weren't scolded by him. His words were slurred and difficult to understand. Sometimes, he may even give the wrong instruction and blame me for it. On the day of my 2nd TP test (failed the 1st with him), he asked me to U-turn at a point where I was quite sure U-turning was not allowed, but did so anyway because I trusted his experience. I got shouted at after that because U-turning wasn't allowed and he said he asked me to turn right. You may be wondering why I didn't clarify my doubts with him, but it was because earlier in the lesson, he asked me to turn right and I did, only to get reprimanded because he wanted me to turn left instead.

3. He reprimanded me for things that wouldn't get me penalized in the TP test. Admittedly, I am not as skill","['Wow I would have completely flipped. Kudos for passing. May I know which class of license and how many TP tests did you take? What was your journey like? \n\nFor myself, I am currently learning 3A in Ubi CDC. Under the school route.

Plenty of encouragements and occasional nuggets of advice. As a result, I was very relaxed. I breezed through the courses effortlessly without even the need for corrections. \n\nThe next lesson (on gradient), I had an instructor  (different one) that nagged and scolded non-stop. He didn’t use personal attacks but his body language was super unpleasant (slapping his forehead repeatedly, etc).

rrxmu9,TIFU by hobo-ing so well a Malay man came and gave me money?,"Basically, I was sent to woodlands by my dad to deliver a parcel, so I went there with 0 grooming. I was wearing checkered pyjamas, had extremely messy curly hair and worn out slippers and a drawstring bag. After I delivered the parcel, I tabaoed a Nasi lemak set B from the nearby Ananas Cafe clone in a styrofoam box. I then sat on the floor at one corner of the MRT station cuz there was no more dine in space left due to covid distancing, and I was hungry and impatient and didn’t care that I looked like a hobo. I also didn’t buy a drink because I don’t like sweet drinks. 

Then, this Malay man came to me , greeted me with Salam (Muslim greeting) started speaking Malay. I told him I’m Muslim but I can’t speak Malay. He then told me that it’s good to have a drink with my meal, and passed me $2 to buy a drink with it. I told him that I didn’t want a drink, tried to explain to him that I don’t need the money and but it was too late. He wished me well and left.
I felt kinda embarrassed after that, gave the money to an uncle selling tissues nearby and left too. 

Now, I’m not super wealthy but I’m pretty well to do. I’m a uni student, was wearing my University Matriculation card in a card holder around my neck and 44mm Apple Watch when the incident happened but I think he didn’t see these LOL. Or maybe he did and I’m overthinking this? 

Anyway, I wanna ask did the man actually think I was someone who would need the money, or is it a Malay thing to give strangers money for drinks? I don’t have a lot of Malay friends who I can ask so I’m not sure haha. Or could these be some other reason I was given the money? 

Either way it’s a really funny story LOL","['bless that man\n\npay it forward', ""I once crossed the road near Cineleisure at Orchard Building, narrowly avoided a car, and when I reached the other side, a passerby I didn't know took me aside and went:\n\n'How long does it take to go to the Scape crossing, cross there and cross back?'\n\n'Would you gain 3 minutes?'\n\n'How long does it take to recover from a fracture?'\n\nThen like 5 seconds later:\n\n'Is it truly worth it?'\n\nWhat's a bit harder to get across in text format is the expression he had.

Malays seem to be more likely to do this in my experience, but concern for your fellow man is not a Malay-exclusive trait.\n\nP.S. This encounter was life changing in other ways.

I am someone who has a hard time saying no, so whenever I come across someone attempting to sell me something, I always give them at least 1-2 minutes of my time to hear them out, bc I know they’re humans too and just doing their job. 

I first got approached outside Bedok MRT, and I’m a student, so I guess I was their “target market”. The guy was nice, still made small talk with me abt school. Even though I repeatedly said that I prefer reading books (seriously hate the idea of someone reading to me) , he kept going on and on and I felt super bad so I just stood there. In the end, I did not get the subscription, and he was ob disappointed (I anyhow say I got to ask my parents and he was like ‘huh 18 years old alr still need ask parents?’) 

Then I got approached by another guy, this time outside Raffles Place MRT station. I was literally like ‘yes I’ve spoken to another Storytel salesperson before, I very much prefer reading books than listening to them’ he followed me and was like ‘ehhhhh come listen’ or smth.

jk2tp3,A story of a cancer ridden NSF. Journey from PES A to PES F.,"\[REPOST\] - I am now officially discharged from NS and am in a better position to share my story. Thank you to everyone who sent kind and thoughtful messages when I first posted. Much love <3

Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my rite of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly the worst cough and thought to myself;

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior""

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough (it had started getting better by itself prior to that so didn’t see the urgency). I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health.

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different","['Glad you managed to fight it!

# Safety protocols, safety timeouts, apologies – When will we ever learn?

First and foremost, I’m not against NS, nor am I calling for the resignation of anyone. The purpose of this post isn’t to jump on the bandwagon and “bash” SAF, but to try to make sense of all the stories, opinions and evaluations from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aj7vlt/about_safety_protocols_in_saf_and_why_they_might/). Neither am I here to speculate about the recent accident.

When will we ever learn? [This is the fourth training related death in the past 18 months](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/aloysius-pang-saf-training-related-death-in-18-months-mindef-11160364) and every single time we have seen the same actions being taken – Call for COI, call for safety timeout, punish a few scapegoats, wait for things to subside and repeat. The problem isn’t with the safety protocols, in fact I would go on to suggest that the safety protocols are very well written and covers most, if not all of the potential risks involved in the trainings. As several have pointed out, it’s impossible to ensure a 100% safety rate when there’s always a chance for human error.

&#x200B;

[Looking at the comments and stories posted by fellow Singaporean Sons about NS, these are the few consistent points being brought up:](https://imgur.com/a/zDenony)(Click link to read all the stories)

* Chao-keng culture - where people who are legitimately sick refuse to seek medical attention for fear of reprisals, either from platoon mates or from higher ups
* · Culture of enduring/suck-it-up – where people just endure through obvious injuries by self-medicating in order not to look weak
* · Culture of targeting people around the individual instead of him – Where higher ups threaten to extend punishments to the whole platoon because of the actions of a single person falling out/","[' [""*If any SAF soldier detects an unsafe practice, he should inform his commander or stop training to protect himself or his buddies. No one needs to fear any disciplinary action for doing right to protect lives during training.*""](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ajc1oc/if_any_saf_soldier_detects_an_unsafe_practice_he/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the perfect scenario that the Minister hoped to have in the system, but unfortunately it also shows how unrealistic & out of touch he is with the entire army culture. As much as we hope, the number of people serving at the nation as NSF/Regular at the same time makes it really difficult to ensure the rules are followed strictly by every single one of them. It\'s not just the safety protocol has to be relooked into. The entire culture needs to be improved to ensure that everyone no matter how high rank they are, are willing to listen & understand everyone\'s opinion/concern. I hope this incident pave a new way of how SAF work as a whole and the current generation of SAF force are able to set a better example to the future NSF/regular to be. ', 'Ironic how soldiers who would readily sacrifice themselves at war for the country die in NS instead.', 'Maybe I can share a particularly good NSF experience that is rather different. I was in OCS 5 years ago and my wing (company) was about to set off on a 16km route March. One of my platoon mates had a slight fever and headache and we told him to rest and fall out. But being the OCS cadet he was, he wanted to push on. Our wing commander then came down to inspect us and when he saw that my platoon mate was looking, unwell, he asked him if he was feeling okay. When the wing commander found out he had a fever, he stopped everything and shouted ""FUXK YOU YOU UNDERSTAND! SAFETY IS FCKING IMPORTANT AND IF YOU ARE FEELING UNWELL YPU BETTER FKING FALL OUT!"" He then lectured our whole platoon about the importance of safety and looking out for one another, and eventually for our fellow NSF when we enter into the units. This really stuck with me and I would like to say not every high ranking commander in SAF are as incompetent as the common narrative make them out to be. There are of course good commanders that really care about the people under them.', 'Honestly fuck the culture of punishing ppl around the individual instead of the individual alone. I always don\'t understand why this logic freaking exists in the first place. There are so many instances during my time in NS where this happened and the fucking commanders always say this magic phrase as if it will remove all blame that naturally occurs when you pit ppl against each other like that.\n\n""Remember guys u are one team.

Successful risk management systems in other industries understand that to prevent incidents, a systems approach and a safety culture is necessary. When an incident occur, a root cause analysis is required rather than simply looking at the circumstances preceding the incident. I am not sure if the COI actually look into this. Root cause analysis can undercover latent conditions contributing to the incident. Some latent conditions include a stressful working condition and a constant fear of punishment which is highlighted by many who served the army."", ""People fail to realise that culture is a result of people.\n\nInclude the ones at the bottom.\n\nIn the past the fear is really more valid.\n\nNow with social media, hotlines, many senior commanders will also say feel free to jump chain of command where necessary.\n\nNo longer back in the days if you skip command chain get punish if it's necessary.\n\nSome will say It's not true.

The people threatening punishments are cogs and wheels in the organization and does not represent the organization or culture as a whole.\n\nBy insisting that nothing good will come out of reporting is in itself a bad culture.\n\nThe part where chao keng and others get punish is also a bad culture. Should punish the individual and the individual should not chao keng. That's 2 problem not one.\n\nBullying the blur, slow or make mistakes. Bad culture. Done by the lowest group of people themselves.\n\nChange doesn't mean organization only.\n\nChange also means every single one of you complaining about it as well.""]"

>""In 2019, the police attended to an incident of attempted suicide involving the then 14-year-old. Following the incident, he was taken into custody for his safety and subsequently referred to IMH for assessment. He was then discharged. Given the circumstances, we are submitting that he requires psychiatric evaluation.""

>There was no one else in court save for court officers, police personnel and the media.


Now about IMH.

IMH houses patients with various illnesses such as bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD and others. They put them in individual wards. Imagine you come into one of the wards for depression and at one corner you see a person tied up to a bed and another corner you see a guy screaming for his parents. **It's quite insane**


Thankfully, this 16-year-old boy (who was then 14 years old) don't have to go through all these because there is a special place for him, **Sunrise Wing**. Sunrise Wing is the only psychiatric ward that serves children which is a relief because the environment will be less tense. **Unfortunately, children are more emotionally sensitive than adults** so any presence of tension would be worse for the kids than the adults. The environment will be different but still not good.


There are different types of therapies and some are more useful than others but **it's up to the patients them","['We should also learn not to paint all mental health cases under the ""insane"" umbrella term. There are many varying degrees and manifestations of mental illness and society should learn to differentiate and understand them rather than stigmatise all the afflicted.', 'OP wrote - “In the boy’s case, the parents are not even coming to court, they know that they have failed.”\n\nTo be fair, we really don’t know the real situation of the family.  Also, there is no reason for the family to be in court for the following reasons:\n1. At this stage, it is merely part of the court proceedings to read charges, which prosecutors have made known the day before, that they are going to charge the boy with murder. So this court proceeding is merely a formality.\n2. The boy himself is in remand. He was called via video link to court. Even if he were physically present in court, the family can’t reach out and talk to him. \n3. If the family were to be at court, they will get swamped by reporters and this will just make it even more traumatizing for the family.\n\nAs such, I believe after consulting their lawyers, they stayed back.\n\nNow, once trial begins, then I believe the family will be present in court.', ""Very true that the general awareness regarding mental health here in Singapore is quite dismal. And let's not even talk about awareness - just being a decent human being seems so difficult. Look at how insensitive mainstream media was yesterday at RVHS, and all the social media comments.\n\nWe're really a First World Nation with Third World people."", ""Thank you OP for sharing this!\n\nJust wanted to list down some myths/common comments while we're on this topic:\n\n\n-**counselling did not work for my friend/me -> all counsellors are useless**- there are thousands of therapy approaches out there, with dozens of more empirically validated ones. And each counsellor is also unique in his/her ways of implementing each approach. Saying this is like stereotyping an entire race based on one individual, or saying that all guys/girls are hopeless based on one failed Tinder date. Sharing your own negative experiences is fine, but generalising one experience to all could shut down this possible pathway of help for someone else in need, who could have benefited from therapy. \n&nbsp;  \n\n **He is just crazy/xiaolang/hopeless / it must be because of [insert reason]** - mental health disorders are extremely, extremely *complex*. It is not like one can just suddenly get afflicted with a mental disorder (like getting covid), but there are multiple biological, psychological, social and cultural factors that can predispose, trigger and/or perpetuate the condition. It is really oversimplifying if we were to speculate anything based on just the media reports.   \n&nbsp;\n\n **What's the point of psychiatric assessment? How can he be let off lightly for killing someone?** - continuing from my above comments, it's not that he is *entirely* not responsible for his actions. Of course he is, to the extent determined by his mental culpability during the crime. But I personally don't think that it is as black-and-white as he is just evil/crazy, and that he could be a victim of whatever he's facing too. I know it is repulsive to some people to show empathy or humanise serious offenders, but this is a 16-year old boy, someone's son/friend/classmate/student, and not just a 2-dimensional character from some TV series.  \n&nbsp;\n\nI think what's more important now is really advocating for greater mental health resources, instead of critizing the effectiven"", '100% agree. \n\nWent to A&E for trying to overdose last year during lockdown.

It's really jarring and discourages you from wanting to visit IMH again, also contributes to the inner stigma you already have about the place. Unfortunately, private therapy providers are so expensive in Singapore. I moved overseas in 2019 and since then, I actually started going regularly to therapy because 1) the stigma isn't there, people openly talk about it and 2) it's much cheaper than in Singapore, and it helped me so much."", '[deleted]', 'EDIT:\nI saw that my comment was highlighted on OP’s post. Thank you for the feature - but I would also like to emphasize that these opinions are mine and mine alone. Not all practitioners may share my views (though if they actually believe our mental health efforts are sufficient, I’d be raising my eyebrows). \nI am also no longer with IMH, so do take my thoughts with a pinch of salt!! :-) \n\n~\n\nAm a counsellor and I’ve been based at IMH previously. Just giving my two cents:\n\nI agree with OP: Whatever system we have in place now is crap. It is an immediate reflection of a society that has never prioritized mental health support. It is a reflection of a population that ignored mental health struggles for the longest time. Practitioners are also overloaded and burning out quickly. Subsidized clinics take a long time to see you and private clinics are exorbitant. There is little to no compassion in Singapore.. and it’s sad.\n\nYou will never receive immediate solutions when dealing with mental health - and that’s where many people decide that seeking help and support pointless. Especially in a place like SG where everyone is so objective-oriented. Life will always be difficult, work will always be tough and family will continue to be estranged for some time… it’s a long process before you notice improvements, and takes so much patience and resilience to work through all of that. These issues are painfully difficult to confront too. It’s easier to smack a “siao lang” label over everything and move on with life. \n\nThere are so many confounds as to why medication/therapy won’t work…. And as a counsellor, I’m feeling drained and exhausted as I work against the current with these convoluted beliefs and expectations. Imagine making good progress with a child and one stupid, insensitive remark from an ignorant adult can erase all that we’ve built together. All it takes is one person to make an uneducated comment about medication, and you see people avoid it like the plague. All i', ""Typing from a perspective who was mentally ill before. Those who are battling their illness while reading this, don't give up and have your medications as per doctor's instructions. Do not 'think' u r feeling better so skip medication. Your thoughts are not facts! Always talk to someone trustworthy and qualified! Our local mental health system for assistance is strong. Other than IMH, there r many local hospitals, private clinics or even some polyclinics which are qualified to help you. If you are feeling not like yourself, you are not alone, reach out! You will be surprised that many good-willed humans are ready to fight the battle together with you!"", '> And that is why mental health awareness is super important. Names such as Beyond the Label and SAMH are promoting mental health awareness.\n\nYup, [Beyond the Label](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/our-initiatives/beyond-the-label/about-the-campaign)', ""I do agree.\n\nTo add, there is a difference between a mental health struggle and a mental health disorder. I personally think one needs introspective/guidance work, while the other needs a combination of that and medicine. I think most Singaporeans would assume if you go to a counselor/therapist, you have a couple of screws loose in your head.\n\nAll people are susceptible to mental health struggles. Mental health is a state of mind just like physical health, our state of fitness. If one doesn't take good care of it or are under bad circumstances, you'll be more likely to struggle.\n\nDepression, anxiety, PTSD - they don't discriminate amongst people whether you are poor or rich. They don't have overwhelming physical symptoms like a physical illness - and more often than not people tend to hide these 'symptoms' of disinterest, low energy, and unwillingness to participate in activities due to the discrimination in society."", 'Thanks OP for this. Aside from the specifics of this case which are too early for us to discuss on, I think it\'s very true that being open about mental health is becoming increasingly important. \n\nI once heard from a psychiatrist specialising with children that building resilience and having support in place are the most important defences against children choosing to take their own lives, or to take lives lightly. Without a healthy goal in life and appropriate doses of small failures and successes, it can become a time bomb that children may either end up not being able to take set-backs or feel that their life is not worthwhile. So it\'s not just a matter of putting protective bubbles around children, but giving children the space and time to learn about life, develop some goals and aspirations (not tied to their parents\') and then have successes and failures along the way to build resilience and find meaning. I believe the older generations don\'t quite understand how the younger folks feel these days partly coz in the past, hardship was generally the norm, and you\'d just suck it up.

He was on medication for quite awhile and seemed to get better (from the meds I\'m sure, his parents were clearly never supportive and always held their other ""normal"" sons in higher regard, which I\'m sure only made him feel worse), and his parents just let him ""go back"" into the society and hopefully hold a job, almost as if convincing themselves that the mental health issues could be wished or faded away with time.

yfwpio,"BlueSG launched their new cars, and it’s a step in the right direction…to getting rid of bad drivers.","BlueSG’s recent upgrade from the very French Bollere BlueCar to the latest Opel Corsa-E is definitely a welcome surprise. 

I’ve been a big fan of BlueSG for a little more than a year now due to my hatred of mass public transport, as well as the abhorrence of the prices of decent cars in Singapore. However, the original Bolleré BlueCar isn’t a car that I would happily choose to be driving, it was out of mere necessity and convenience. Let’s get into that before we talk about the latest Opel offering. 

The BlueCar is quintessentially French in a way that it’s *in a horrid French accent* “let’s design a car that is too big to be small, too small to be big. And oh we should uh, put the speedo in the middle and have the dashboard be the width of the English Channel where if you put your phone anywhere near it, it would disappear into a inch wide gap much further than your arms can reach. Also for some reason, the gearstick is the other way around to confuse everyone. And 50hp is tres bien, also also we need the throttle pedal to feel like brake pedal and the brake pedal to feel like the throttle pedal. 

Odd, exceedingly French design a little better than the Fiat Multipla aside, everything about it screamed “look at moi, I am no more zhan 500 euro” down to the extremely bad stereo and stitching (or the lack of). It’s the first car I’ve ever felt that it was a box on wheels that would only be required to ferry me from point a to point b with a high to very high chance of dying before I reach my destination. 

Now to my first drive of the Opel/Vauxhall/Peugeot Corsa-E/208 whatever you wanna call it. I jumped on the old BlueCar to drive about 10 minutes to the nearest Opel that was somewhere in the middle of Pasir Ris with a sense of anticipation to drive the new car, where the driving experience of the older offering definitely amplified.

8031s7,ofo Bike 2.0 Review,"Before I begin, I would like to clarify that I am in no way paid/sponsored/requested by ofo to do this review. I am a regular Redditor just like you and wanted to put this up for the benefit of other shared bike users.

Story time: 
I was walking home when I spotted [this](https://i.imgur.com/krswDtV.jpg) (which I will refer to as ofo 2.0 throughout this post for simplicity) parked outside a shelter. I saw it a few days back on r/singapore and has been yearning to ride it since. With some free time and the $1.50 60 days coupon which I bought a few days back, I decided to give it a try.


Review:
The first thing about ofo 2.0 that shocked me is how adjustable the [seatpost](https://i.imgur.com/PHWMbIb.jpg) is. I've tried almost all the bikes from Mobike and oBike and the thing that disappoints me every time is the seat, which are either stuck or the full length of extension is still too short for me (am 1.76m). With ofo 2.0, I extended it fully to the 185 mark and is very comfortable as I am able to fully extend my legs for my downward pedal stroke. +1 to ofo 2.0 for the tallest seatpost in any shared bike right now.

The next thing I notice as I pushed off is the [basket](https://i.imgur.com/xxy9AmW.jpg). I mean, look at that depth. This can easily fit your Cai Png dabao and you now don't have to worry about your meal dropping out of the basket while you cycle. It can also easily fit a medium-sized backpack for students or working adults. Another +1 to ofo 2.0 for the most spacious basket mounted on any shared bike right now.

What surprised me next is how light this bike feels. There is a pretty steep slope near my block which so far I only scaled with my own MTB which has adjustable gears. Usually I would push a shared bike up the slope. However, I felt confident today and decided to pedal up the slope. Holy molly, I actually cleared the climb while seated on the bike seat. Then again, this is probably due to seatpost being extended so I could exert my full streng","[""I'm just hoping the new bikes won't be prone to squeaky noises that the current bikes have"", ""Quality OC, OP. Btw the brakes on most of these shared bikes are drum brakes which definitely can't compare to disc in terms of weight, stopping power and modulation.

Didn't know about these. My brother uses shared bikes when he visits and really needs the high adjustable seats. He's over 180cm. Hope these are rolled out all over soon.

1beardy,I JUST PASSED MY DRIVING TEST! here’s some tips which helped,"I just passed my driving test after have to do 2 retest. Man it was absolutely mortifying to have to see the same instructors. Even during the warm up, the instructor was like ‘you dont want to pass today?’. However, the tester was really nice. He made small talk with me, made me feel comfortable. So here are some tips:

- ALWAYS LOOK BACK WHEN PARKING LOOK BACK

- For reverse (no pole): 

Full Lock Right 3.5 blocks (black and white) is at your shoulder

- For reverse with pole: 

Must touch the ledge gently. then must go up. dont touch the pole. Once it touches, drop, then full lock right. Remember to make sure you’re in the centre so that the car wont get stuck in the middle (its an IF)

- For vertical parking: 

drive all the way in-front, make sure your shoulder touches the number. Then reverse till back line aligns w the bar (black/white) in the middle after the corner. Then full lock left. Bring down mirrors to check. (Start Further from curb)

- For Parallel parking:

Bring mirror down. Then when the front door lock handle back touches the end of the curb, full lock left. check the left mirror to see the white block until you see a bit of the black. Then straighten reverse till u touch yellow line. Bring mirror down. Then full lock right. Make sure to reverse before driving off. (Start Close to curb)

- When he slaps the board, E Brake.

- Don’t exceed speed limit when driving outside

- STOP AT STOP LINE (how i failed the first time).

Mentally, i really had to control my breathing. Remember to breathe into your stomach, not your chest (makes you even more nervous.) For those retaking, just think of the circuits. Dont think of whats next, dont think of the points, dont look at the tester. Dont look at his screen. Just be present. If you can take the test, it means you have all the knowledge and skills you need to pass it. Also dont count your eggs before they hatch. The test isnt over till you turn off the engine. Trust yourself and your judgement. BE CONFID",[]
lzneds,Straits Times: Transgender issues are real concerns that should not be dismissed,"(reposting since original was deleted for paywall). 

ST Premium opinion article questioning the idea that trans issues are “imported”, citing the long history of trans people and related policies in Singapore; discusses issues trans students face in school, and highlights the case study of another JC student, this time a trans boy who was told by his school that he had to be sterilized and undergo sex reassignment surgery if he wanted to be able to wear pants instead of a skirt to school; explains why it is not reasonable to require trans students to delay transition until after graduation; and that what trans youths need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by their parents, teachers and other adults in their life.

The full post is available on the Pink Dot Facebook page and I’ll drop it in a comment here.","['When a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms, is it a case of America\'s culture war over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and queer (LGBTQ) issues being imported into Singapore?\n\nOr could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about?\n\nPerhaps a mix of both?\n\nDepending on where your sympathies lie, one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you. \n\nIn January, Ashlee, a teenage transgender girl in junior college, complained in an online post that the Ministry of Education (MOE) had intervened with her treatment, preventing her from obtaining a doctor\'s referral letter to begin hormone therapy.\n\nThe post went viral, attracting much debate over gender identity issues and MOE\'s policies when dealing with trans students. Days later, a group of five individuals protested against MOE\'s handling of the case outside its building in Buona Vista. Three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit.\n\nWhen the issue was raised in Parliament on Feb 1, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student, parents and doctors, and MOE did not have purview over them. He expressed concern that gender identity issues have become ""bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some Western countries and societies"".\n\nHe added: ""We should not import these culture wars into Singapore, or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society.""\n\nCultural imports?\n\nIndeed, in the United States and Britain, fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports, military service and gender-segregated spaces like bathrooms.\n\nBut it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in Singapore, they are considered on their own merit, and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas.\n\nMr Wong\'s cautionary note about ', 'By Rei Kurohi, one of the few legit journalists here.', 'Reposting from the previous thread\n\n__________\n\nTrans people have been a large part of Singapore society going as far back as the 1950s - 1980s.

It was based on a technique invented by Benjamin Sheares, who also served as our second president, then adapted by S Shan Ratnam for transsexuals. Singapore was renowned in Asia for having the most skilled surgeons with regards to transgender surgeries up until the early 1990s. Transexuals have been legally allowed to change their sex and have been able to legally marry the opposite sex since the 1970s.\n\nIf anything, Singapore has imported the conservative, transphobic attitudes of Christian fundamentalists from the west, which led to the government cleansing and eradicating our trans culture.\n\nSupporting transsexuals and their rights would simply be reverting our country\'s stance on trans people back to what it was before we ""imported"" conservative Christian attitudes from the west.\n\nThe largest cultural wars that have been imported were those waged by fundamentalist Christians. Yet for some fucking sad irony, it is these same people who seem to be under the misbelief that their ""traditional"" cultures and values are under attack by ""the western liberals"".', ""I may not be transgender, but i can empathize. I also hate housework, pressure to be ladylike, and wearing dresses (uncomfortable bc fat).\n\n\nNow is 2021 already but sg schools are still stuck in uniforms and girls must wear skirts and tie plaits (like archaic Nan Hua).

I certainly agree that there needs to be more conversations in this area. Dismissing transgender issues as mere “culture wars” does not help, as doing so just further widens the us vs them divide. Gender identity issues are a concern that encompasses the entire human race and are most certainly not a “East vs West” difference in ideology. \n\nThe other aspect that concerns me is the delay in education that such individuals face in the two examples listed. For a country that prides itself on having some of the highest education standards on the global stage, the recent stance taken by the government with regards to this incident sure is a disappointing one to take.', 'Its a really well-written article, and I hope that our society becomes more inclusive over time. I recall a few years ago when MOH/HPB had an online infographic about trans/LGBT health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society. So sometimes, we can\'t expect ministries or govt to ""take the lead"", because there has been more than one time when ministries are progressive but get whacked by society. \n\nI do have one gripe about this article, which is this: \n\n""To avoid a culture war, these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology"". \n\nScience does have a role in addressing some of these questions, but at the end of the day, morality and ethics has to answer the most important parts. And it\'s bad to shove it all to science and technocrats, because science doesn\'t have these answers. \n\nFor example, there is a question as to whether should minors be allowed to go through permanent procedures. Science can\'t answer such a question. Science can tell us that gender dysphoria is a mental health condition, but science won\'t tell you that the best way to address this is by allowing procedures for minors. Society has to determine what should be the limits of consent. And while a \'culture war\' fuelled by ignorance is bad, a debate about ethics and morality should be viewed as a good thing.

1bjajl8,When to give up MRT Seats?,"This question probably has been asked quite a few times, but I just want to be clear, when should one give up their seat? Recently, I keep seeing parents on the train with kids (5-7) who keep asking their parents loud AF “ why I cannot sit?” Whenever this happens, someone will always be guilted into giving up their seat for the kid, and the person beside them will also feel guilty if they don't give up their seat, because it’s like separating the parent and the kid. IMO, the only people who should be given seats are very old, frail elderly (70-80+ with a lot of laorenban or have a full head of gray hair. ), or heavily pregnant women that look like they gonna give birth anytime soon. 

I recall being eyeballed by everyone opp me once when I didn’t give up my seat to a 5-7 yo kid standing in front of me, who kept whining to his parent “why no seats for me?” The kid and parent had gotten on the train after my stop, and alighted before my stop. They stood for a total of 5 minutes. Maybe it was my upbringing, but I never whined to my mom about no seats on public transport when I was a child. I would wait, if someone gave their seat to me, I’ll be happy and my mom would tell me to say thank you. I would be paiseh and grateful to the person. I NEVER felt entitled to a seat just for being a kid. 

People all pay train fare. We are all entitled to a seat on a FCFS basis and we give it up when we want. People have invisible pain. A relative of mine had cancer really young, she looked healthy in the initial stages, but had frequent dizziness and still had to stand on public transport. We don’t know if someone has a longer journey, headaches or menstrual cramps (for females). What we do know is that children 5-7 have no worries, and are less likely to have these invisible pains esp if they have the energy to climb and fidget in a seat. I‘ll give up my seat to a kid who DOESN’T ask for it, I will not give it to a entitled brat who whines to his parent about “why I no seats?

d8mfnd,Why the Green movement in Singapore makes me angry,"I'm a green blooded environmentalist. I keep my waste paper, plastic bottles and cardboard and wait for a karang guni to give them to. (Sometimes I actually go out of my way to find an uncle and aunty to give it to them). I read up on development of green tech and fossil fuels(tbh kind of a necessity since I've started investing). For years, I'd wished there was a green movement in SG. 
I was so happy with the SG clinate rally and everything that has transpired over social media over the past few months. I'm one of those that believe society should take more initiative, and we shouldnt let the government dictate moral codes and how we should live. 

But my god, the green movement here makes me so angry. Ive seen some youtube/facebook comments and even heard some people irl that disparaged it. The truth is , I have to agree. These guys want to shut down Jurong Island(which provide almost 1/4 of our gdp) and outsource energy development to ASEAN so that we dont have to use fossil fuels. Holy shit, we are trying our best to be water independent for a reason. They say nothing about air-conditioning, about the loss of primary forests, about our continued lack of centralised cooling etc. They want to alienate the general population before the movement even takes off. 
Keep in mind, this is all while they assume that Green energy is carbon free, which is not true. The development, manufacture and disposal of renewable infrastructure like Solar panels have massive negative environmental effects(google it if you want to know more). 

They talk about raising carbon taxes to shutting down Jurong Island. Im so done. Lets be clear, if what they suggest are all implemented, life would get wayyy worse without tangible improvements to our carbon footprint. For example, a carbon tax works if we have alternatives and we dont really have any, so itll just drive up cost.

The purpose of a carbon tax is to simply let the pricing of things to reflect its real cost, the existence of alternatives is no reason against such a tax. In fact, carbon tax is *the* best solution to climate change.\n\nCorporations are incentivized to seek other production methods to reduce their cost, which will eventually provide alternatives and thus fulfilling the purpose of the tax. Consumer side, it disincentivize consumption which again, is the purpose of the carbon tax.

And that will, in no small part, be due to climate change. \n\nOn the non-climate change aspect, we have China and its One Belt, One Road Policy, which is developing ports in Malacca to serve as a waypoint on its trade routes. This will inevitably reduce shipping traffic passing through Singapore, reducing our profits from Bunkering. There isn\'t much that we can do about this, besides suck it up. \n\nOn the climate-change aspect, we have the melting Arctic, which is opening up new, more efficient sea-trading routes. The worlds biggest emitters, especially the US and Russia, have a vested interest in this happening, as not only will they be able to utilize these new trade routes, they would also be interested in exerting sovereign rights over the marine resources in this region.

The Gross Domestic Product per capita in Singapore was last recorded at 52600.60 US dollars in 2016 for that year. From here: https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/gdp-per-capita

Total paid hours worked per employee per week in 2015 is 45.6. From here: http://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Hours-Worked-Summary-Table.aspx

There are 52 weeks in a year. So, the GDP per capita per week is 52600/52=1011USD$.
In a week, an average worker works 45.6hours. Therefore, per hour the average worker is paid 1011/45.6=22USD$

Granted, I did some rounding adjustments here and there, but this is the general pay. As of now, USD$22 = SGD$29.94. For ease of calculations in future, I will take it as a worker’s average hourly pay in Singapore is SGD$30. There are of course outliers, those who earn a lot less and a lot more, and perhaps I should take the median, but I was interested in getting fast results. Plus, workers who are affected by MRT breakdowns, will affect those higher up, even those who do not use MRT.

“LRT led the growth with an 18.4 per cent increase in ridership to 180,000 a day. The MRT followed with a 7.8 per cent rise to 3.1 million rides a day - the first time it has breached the three million mark.” This quote is from here: https://www.gov.sg/news/content/the-straits-times---bus-rail-ridership-soars-to-new-high

Total ridership of MRT alone is 3.1 million rides a day. There is a negligible amount of people taking the mrt outside of the peak hours. Not everyone take the MRT during the peak hours, but everyone is definitely somehow affected by this. Let’s round it down to 3 million during peak hour to make it easier to calculate for me.

Also, imagine that someone takes the MRT to work in the morning, then takes the MRT home at night. So, 3million/2= 1.5 million commuters in the morning and at evening.

Therefore, per hour of breakdown, we lose
Worker hourly average pay x number of workers=","[""let's see who picks this up as an article of their own…"", ""Here's another hard-to-calculate factor for you - the amount of time wasted by drivers and their passengers in the ensuing traffic snarl caused by the activation of free bus bridging services whenever the MRT breaks down. "", ""0 dollars.\n\nBecause not company's fault for you being late for work.\n\nYou can always wake up earlier and go home later. GDP comes first. /s"", 'Singapore lost the head of maintenance and some rank and file workers. 😡😡😡']"
196e2v8,I *try* to illustrate the technical difficulties in displaying SimplyGo balance,"Disclaimer:  I do not work for EZ-Link/SimplyGo. These diagrams are merely  speculation from my experience as a software engineer. For those in the  know, please correct me if there are any misconceptions on my part. 

The main problem with showing balances upon tap-out, is illustrated in C2 -> C5.

Additional communications with the backend servers can introduce latency(delays) in the tap-in/out process. A one second delay on \*each\* tap could cause massive jams at gantries during peak hours.

Note: I don't necessarily agree with the decision to deprecate EZ-Link. They can spend resources to maintain it. But since I don't know the actual costs, I will not speculate on this decision.

191mv47,My brutal thoughts on Evolve MMA as a student of five years,"  

**Disclaimer**: These are my personal opinions as someone that has trained only Muay Thai as well as the warriorfit conditioning program at Evolve, for an average of 10 hours a week over the past five years. As such, do not use this post as a reflection of the training in BJJ or MMA at the gym. This is a 100% subjective opinion that is not meant to diss the gym outright, but to share some of my thoughts on why turnover is increasing and why members may seek greener pastures elsewhere.

I will start my post by saying this. After five years of training at Evolve, 10 hours on average, I have decided to call it quits. I’m not sure if I will be choosing to head to another MT gym or just take a break for a bit and do something else, but I think that I need to shake things up as there are things about the gym that I feel are starting to really limit my enjoyment. I will share my reasons why below. 

**Cost:**

EVOLVE in fairness has not increased its price that much over the years, but that being said it is still on average \~$4.2k SGD a year for unlimited classes. That puts it as the most expensive MT gym in Singapore, with the next higher tier being Pineapple MMA at around $3.5k, and subsequently most gyms will have a yearly package for $2.6k or so. Stuff is expensive in Singapore and I understand that, so previously I didn’t mind cause you get discounts the longer you re-sign with Evolve, and I felt the quality and experience was there to justify it. Unfortunately I can no longer say this is the case.

**Class structure:** 

Evolve has levels for its classes – level 1, level 2, level 3 etc. (I know how this community feels about grading and I will not disagree) sparring is only unlocked above level 2 and on average most people will take 8-12 months to get level 2. Beyond that though there doesn’t seem to be any real criteria for who gets promoted, although there are whispers it is based on duration spent and from observations I would have to agree. (level 3 guys ive","['Thanks for the insight - I once checked out EVOLVE and they refused to tell me the package prices or even give me any sort of ballpark range. Instead they bombarded me with a ton of questions about how I found out about their gym etc and pushed for me to come for a free training class and “discuss package options later”\n\nThat’s bad enough for me', ""I'll be pissed if I'm paying so much and spend half the time doing warm up and cardio instead of spending time with the instructor. \n\nMy old gym expects you to reach half hour early to warm up, shadow box, and be gloved up when lessons start at the scheduled time."", ""Read all the comments here and agree with 99.9% of them.\n\nI used to be in the back office, so this is what we see BTS. Everything you read and watch that is Evolve-branded has to go through me first.\n\nEvolve is 100% corporate. Don't delude yourself that it's a homey gym etc. There's always a focus on revenue (fair enough since its a business) rather than improving the learning experience for current members. When I was there, we were always talking about selling more and more of the Evolve University video packages, tickets to live fights and recruiting new members.\n\nDuring my time, there was absolutely no mention or discussion about level 2/3 MT students. Senior management is always asking how we can get more new members. It's absolutely like a pyramid scheme: more new suckers to prop up the entire wobbly structure. Why else do you get so many overpriced seminars?\n\nThe culture you experience is a direct result of how things are run. The good instructors leave because they're SEVERELY overworked. \n\nExample is Nong O. Teaches classes in the day and trains for his fights between classes. Then he's tapped to record videos for Evolve University, Evolve's YouTube and other promo material because he's THE face of MT and Evolve. A lot of the University videos are shot after the gym is closed i.e. they only start around 11-12 am and shoot till 4-5 am. I don't think he's paid extra for all this shit. This shit happens pretty much every 2-3 weeks or so.\n\nHow to keep up with this pace? No time for yourself, much less your family. So when Nong O left, someone else has to take his place.\n\nThere's no incentive for Evolve to help you grow. In the back office, there's a standing order to complete over 120 pieces of content (2-3 YT videos, 3 newsletters, 7x blog posts and 7x social media posts PER week among other things) a month for a gym. Your fees are spent on paying senior management to slave drive the back office staff rather than improving your learning experience. Other than "", 'Opinions not welcome in evolve. Hope you find other place to train', 'I\'ve heard similar stuff from several people who have tried training MT at Evolve. \n\nThe complaints I\'ve heard are that the trainers are just going thru the motions, there is little camaraderie among the students, and lackluster interactions between the students and trainers. \n\nThey also lamented the ""corporate"" culture of the gym, and how it tended to attract the atas kind of crowd, which definitely affects the gym culture. Lots of expats and wealthy corporate types. The only people I could see training there would probably be professionals, and amateurs who have the money to spend to feel like they get a ""premium"" experience.\n\nHonestly never considered training there after seeing their prices. They do have some badass trainers though, can\'t deny that. Their gyms also look damn well maintained and clean. However shiny everything is, in the end it\'s the culture and people who make the gym what it is.', 'I have been training at evolve with my gf for more than 5 years. We left in 2022 because of the poor service and many great instructors leaving (e.g. Kru Yod)\n\nPreviously, whenever it’s near the membership renewal, the salesperson would contact me to renew (plus additional renewal benefits). \n\nBut this time they didn’t care to notify me, I didn’t know my contract ended, only found out when I couldn’t login to book classes, emailed and called them but no response. \n\nThe funny thing is, a few weeks later they kept spam emailing me with “We Miss You at Evolve” promotion emails.\n\nI haven’t found another gym yet but am considering Pineapple. I saw many ex-evolve members going there.', 'So I joined Evolve last year. I\'ve been trying out different time slots, and I find the instructors absolutely tailor their classes based on who shows up. The evening slots get a ton of beginners and irregular members (like me :() - and I definitely see them ease up on the training so as not to discourage the newbies.\n\nIt\'s a tough balance, honestly. Popular gyms like Evolve are always going to get droves of newcomers, who far outnumber the advanced folks. I think it\'s less about milking money from ""rich Singaporeans/foreigners"", but more adapting to the clientele who show up.\n\nThat said, I\'m checking the app right now, and I see way more beginner slots - like, three in a row for tomorrow! Clearly accommodating for the New Year Resolution crowd.\n\nI think your criticism is valid, and I also think it\'s not a knock on Evolve. They do what they do well - and it looks like you\'ve outgrown them.', 'That’s close to 20mins (out of a 60 mins class yikes!) spent doing cardio. \n\nMakes no sense to me tbf.', 'Since u not beginner liao, go stare at paikia and spar with them to upskill', 'as a student of 10+ years (on/off, shit’s expensive), let me tell you, the instructors can tell if you are there just to say you go to the gym and if you are there to seriously learn how to fight. \n\nadmittedly the quality of instructors were better before (haven’t been there in awhile) but the ones that are there still push you to be your best, IF they think you want it. \n\nif they see that you’re not really that serious, why would they waste time on you when they could be focusing more on students that do take it more seriously?\n\nhow do i mean take it more seriously? not just going to the evening class, trying out the variety of schedules, krus. going to sparring on weekends, going to the quarterly seminars, etc. \n\nand that has to be on a regular basis. if they see you are just a weekend warrior type, it’s fine they will still give you training but don’t expect to improve if you’re so obviously just going through the motions. \n\nIMO the core advantage of Evolve, the one thing that no other gym in Singapore can offer, is their punishing schedule. every hour on the hour there is a class. you miss the 7pm class? there is an 730 class. you miss that? there is the 8pm. they make themselves as available as possible for the members it’s really unfair to the instructors. \n\ni know. bec ive checked all the other gyms. pineapple, blessed (all good gyms with former evolve instructors but with less classes), juggernaut, trifecta, all the other random shophouse gyms. they all generally have 2 classes in the evening every week and that’s it. sometimes they have one morning class at 10am, when people are at work. \n\nEvolve has classes from 630am and the last class ends almost 10/11pm. that’s insane. but they’re the only ones that have it. \n\nso if you want a flexible schedule, and want to spend a lot of time in the gym, they’re the only ones that can do it. \n\neven if you assume that the quality of instruction is equal across the board. \n\nif that’s not your thing, then maybe Evolve isn']"
ok21pg,Has anyone been charged more by the dentist after he/she finds out you have CHAS card?,"A few days ago I called NTUC Denticare to enquire about the price for polishing/scaling and I was told that it ranges from $50-$110 depending on how dirty your teeth are, which tallies with what's advertised on their website.

A few days later I went down for my appointment and the dentist started off chatting with me. He asked me if I have a CHAS card and then expressed his surprise when he found out that I have a CHAS card even when I have a decent job. He asked if it's because my parents are retired, I didn't want to tell him more so I just replied ""yea"".

After that, he checked my teeth and then told me that I will be charged a certain amount $x for polishing/scaling. I was very surprised to hear that because that amount is higher than the $50-$110 that I was told. I questioned him nicely about it, ""oh that's not what I was told actually..."". He then showed me this laminated sheet that shows ""polishing/scaling --> $50/$110"", and then he added ""oh that price is for children, adults are charged higher"". I did not see that coming coz 1) I wasn't told of that when I called to enquire, 2) That wasn't indicated on their website. I told him that I feel slightly misled and he told me that I could call the appt off if I'm not comfortable with the price. I didn't want to waste anymore time looking for another clinic so yea I agreed to go ahead with it.

After the cleaning and right before I was about to leave he told me, ""oh tbh with you, I'm sorry that the prices weren't conveyed to you properly (I'm not sure if he was referring to himself or to the person that talked to me when I called to enquire), the price that the person told you is just a range, no dentist will charge only $50 for cleaning"". Mannnnnnnn I was shocked to hear that. Does that mean that the range that they advertised is just for show? I didn't want any trouble so I just agreed and left the room.

qoggak,"In a time of constantly shifting goalposts, let's review what the government's past COVID-19 indicators look like today.","It has become a meme that the MTF's objectives and metrics have been constantly shifting throughout the pandemic. Every other week, a new indicator is brought up to discuss COVID-19. Some of these were backed by international research and proven in the real world, while others are seemingly concocted out of nothing and used nowhere else. Since I've been logging the spread of the virus in Singapore for the past half-year, let's go back and review the many ways our government has tried to frame the pandemic to the public.

**1: Case Counts**

[Daily COVID-19 Cases](https://imgur.com/a/8Y8jCNd)

At the very beginning, case counts were the main metric for measuring the disease spread. This is by far the easiest and most understandable way to understand where the virus stands in our community. This method is good on a surface level, but it is highly susceptible to daily changes like public holidays, weekends, or even completely random fluctuations. As a result, I have presented the 7-day rolling average alongside the raw data to even out these variations and extract long term trends from the data. In this way, we don't see anomalies like the 5k case spike last week or the recent Deepavali dip causing drastic shifts. This standard is also being employed by Google, Our World in Data, the New York Times, and many other highly reputable agencies globally.

In the data above, we see that during our exit wave, cases climbed exponentially from late August to mid September followed by several weeks of linear growth. Then, shortly after increasing the level of lockdown in late September, we saw a small downturn in early October before seeing a ""double peak"" around 2 weeks ago. Finally, we are seeing a steady decline in cases over the past seven days. Such a double peak is not a natural phenomenon; virtually every other country and city worldwide saw a single peak in their exit wave 6-8 weeks after the initial spike while our second peak occurred almost 10 weeks later. The on","['Great analysis! I was wondering about the term ""exit wave"" though. It doesn\'t seem like other countries that have gone through an ""exit wave"" (e.g. UK, Germany) have settled into some sort of stability in case numbers, even after widespread vaccination. Are we being too optimistic that this wave would be a one-and-done?', ""They can shift goalposts if they have to but the frustration stems from the lack of clear direction and long term planning, the current measures seem like band-aid solutions to whatever crops up.\n\nSinkies will generally and quietly follow rules as they have been all these years if they have even a bit of understanding on the purpose of the rules.\n\nBut the mmtf seem to lack foresight and can only come up with ridiculous rules and changing goalposts \n\nI don't envy them but heck, they should be worth the  millions they are earning, not to mention they are supposed to be the 4G to lead this country"", 'At this point if someone told me restrictions may be lifted if it rains for 7 days consecutively I will just believe it. Some of these are so arbitrary it really makes no sense', 'Yup. The goalposts get more and more abstract. 😂\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before it gets completely detached from scientific consensus/opinion.', 'Infection rate below 1. So when the f@ck can I eat at the same table with my wife and 1 year old baby!!!!!!!', "" Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. 1.5 years ago, Lee Hsien Loong told us ‘put Singapore on circuit breaker and it will be free from Covid.’ 1.5 years later, Lawrence told us ‘ the pandemic is like computer, it's fluid and dynamic, very complicated.’ And Gan Kim Yong said that during the press conference – I don’t remember what conference - that the vaccination is the key to open up Singapore. Question for you both: is handling of Covid pandemic today too complicated with twenty and more restrictions , are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the roadmap to open up the country? Less restrictions, more? Or less and more communication with the citizens?\n\nAdopted from here https://youtu.be/FlFt_W4664M"", 'To be honest, I do forsee us loosening some restrictions for 3-4 weeks before going back to the status quo again.', 'You can’t compare case counts and infection growth rates meaningfully with prior periods anymore after they implemented the home recovery programme. Nobody knows how many are positive and recovering at home since these numbers are not reported to the authorities. \n\nI can only assume that the 3000 cases are the minority of the actual number of cases that end up being reported daily.', 'The question is if the mmtf will loosen restrictions now that the growth rate is less than 1. My guess is that they will wait for the growth rate to remain below 1 for 1 week at least before making any moves, case numbers would be lower too. Most likely restrictions still remain as is until Nov 21, but I would like to be wrong.\n\nLW has mentioned previously that we are in the big exit wave, but there still will likely be further ""smaller"" waves later on. Therefore, the other pertinent question is, let\'s say the case numbers go up once again after the looser restrictions, would the mmtf tighten once again? I would say don\'t be surprised if they do.', '[removed]']"

So I was driving and i was about to make a left turn. There were 3 freaking motorbikes, 1 went into my blind spot, 2 went right behind my car within inches. so i slowed down to let them passby. 

Stupid thing was, I slow down they dont want slow down, I accelerate they also accelerate, so I tried to make extra care while turning. 

Unfortunately, I cared for my back didnt care for my front. I was so distracted I failed to realize that there was a pedestrian crossing in front of me, and I just drove past it. I noticed an Uncle cycling about to cross the road but dodged back in time. 

Yesit was dangerous and stupid. I shouldnt be on the roads. Im just not that good at managing different stimuli. Will probably have to stayoff the roads after this.

I’m also struggling to understand how this initiative is supposed to be for the visually impaired? What’s the difference between “ding dong next station” and “DINGDANGTINGDANGDINGGDADADA next station?”

If the issue is about the part where the train reaches the station, maybe just do it as “train approaching…paya lebar” since the default announcement when the train departs is “next station…paya lebar”.

It is also puzzling that this only applies to SMRT operated lines. I feel it is so not consistent because SBS operated lines like DTL and NEL won’t have them. Wouldn’t that just confuse visually impaired passengers more?

8yglgt,Has anyone ever encountered entitled elderly folks on the MRT?,"It has actually just happened a few minutes ago.

As I was entering the MRT, I saw an empty seat (not a reserved seat) and I just went ahead to sit on it but I didn’t even notice the lady next to me - did not know whether she was old or young. My default reflex action was to just grab whichever seat was available because I have to travel many stops daily for work.

So then as I sat down, I just started to reply some work emails and chat with friends on Messenger.. When suddenly I heard this lady start mumbling in front of me in Mandarin. I don’t really understand what she’s saying because I’m not very fluent in Mandarin, I could only make out her saying something along the lines of “old already don’t know what to do” (lol direct translation of ‘lao liao zhe me ban’ my pinyin sucks, but she said something like that)

And she seemed damn disgruntled, then the person next to me offered the seat and then she sat next to me and glared at me and my phone.

Like wtf? She didn’t even look that old, and I also needed the seat. There are some other younger folks who sat at the reserved seats while I sat at the normal one, I just don’t understand why she was so entitled about it. It’s the public transport, do you really expect people to give up seats for you all the time?

Sometimes other people are also tired or don’t notice you, so why are you so mad about this. Don’t know why some elderly folks here are so entitled and rude. I had many friends who shared similar experiences too.

Rant over. Anyone experienced something similar as well?","['[deleted]', '[deleted]', ""Dude they're everywhere, not just MRTs. I've had the enjoyment of hearing an Auntie openly bitch about not getting a seat when she got on and proceeded to get off the next stop which was about a min away.

1b3nc03,A creep nudged his shoulder against mine on the train and I didn’t fight back,"This happened to me few weeks ago but I’m still angry about it.

I (33F) was on the train one evening (about 9pm) on the way home. The train wasn’t super crowded but the seats were occupied so I was standing. At one of the stops, I saw someone vacate her seat and alighted the train. I waited for a while to see if anyone took the seat but nobody did so I walked over and sat in it. 

I was leaning forward (elbows on my knees) and engrossed on my phone. About 1 stop later I looked up and noticed this uncle (probably about 60?) staring at my face. Like he literally stuck his neck out and his face was kinda invading my personal space. I have some facial piercings so I’m used to being stared at because of them (especially kids who don’t know any better), so I ignored him thinking he was probably staring at my piercings.

Then he told me “you’re very cute”. I gave him a slight nod but didn’t smile back. I went back to my phone. He asked me “are you Singaporean?” (I could feel his face still near mine). I pretended not to hear him and continued to look at my phone, but internally I kinda froze up and didn’t know how to react. 

He then raised his voice a bit and asked once more ARE YOU SINGAPOREAN while nudging his shoulder against mine. 

Without a word I immediately stood up and walked away to another carriage. I felt so disgusted that I felt like scrubbing my shoulder with bleach. 

Thinking back I’m still angry about it. Not at him, but at myself for not doing more about it. I should have said something, yelled at him, or could have even taken a photo/video of him. But instead all I did was walk away. I’m so mad at myself!!! 

Thinking back, I wonder if that’s the reason why nobody wanted to take the vacant seat? Maybe they had already noticed something amiss but I didn’t notice cos I was standing quite a distance away from the seat. 

A similar incident happened to me when I was 18 (a man put his hand on my thigh). It was the first time something like that happened to ","[""It's true that you could have confronted him or made a scene. But de-escalation is also valid and sometimes the most prudent option. \n\nI've encountered people like this in Singapore and other countries who threaten aggression and/or violence towards me. I think the important part is taking emotion out of it and recognising my personal choice to de-escalate. \n\nWe *could* have escalated but made the explicit choice not to, which is completely fine. Things to consider like what if the uncle got physically violent towards you, what if he had a weapon, could you defend yourself against him alone, if not, what if nobody stands up to help you?\n\nWalking away removes all these what-ifs and prioritises your safety, so it's a great decision imo. 99% of people I know who have trained in any real martial art will choose to walk away for these reasons. So despite choosing not to engage, you shouldn't think of yourself as a victim, rather a smart person who actively made the choice to de-escalate.\n\nI also feel shaken up after these experiences but I hope you can find solace in knowing that you made an intelligent decision despite being under pressure in a dangerous situation\n\nEdit: I just read the last part of your post. I'm really sorry that happened to you. If it helps, some of my female friends who have had similar experiences have shared that learning a self-defence martial art has helped them deal with their trauma to some degree.

175abxf,Is working as an SQ Air steward / stewardess a lucrative job?,"This stems from a conversation at a wedding recently. This auntie was talking non stop about how her daughter is an air-stewardess and how much she is earning monthly.

Sure the pay is good. 90-100hrs monthly flying time is just basic, some colleagues even got 120-140 flying hours; it is dead tiring but the pay is good (at least for them). \n\nThat auntie is proud bec getting in to SQ is hard and it takes a lot of hard work to get that kebaya. But mind you she does not know what happens behind the scenes: the insults we get if we cant produce the quality of food you want, the pulling of our skirts/trouser(in my airline's) or SQ's kebaya just to get our attention, the waving of hands or gestures as if we dun get what u want, our nasty csd or inflight manager doing stuff beyond our control whether the report is true or not and other et ceteras happening at the galley, after flight.

To add on, air stewards were chosen for their physical appearance as well (height, face, posture etc) so there was a belief that if you were chosen meant you were very good looking which adds to the social standing.\n\nNowadays, I think most of us know that air stewards are treated quite poorly (like atas waiters basically), work long, inflexible hours, and have to spend a lot of time away from home, on top of having to keep up with appearances for many hours on end. \n\nThe only ones who still regard air stewards as a ""premium or lucrative"" occupation are those that have no idea the struggles of those actually in the industry.', 'A relative was working as an air stewardess when she met a rich man’s son while working a flight. \n\nThey dated, got married and started a family.

hrjpzu,To the girl who gave me a piece of paper before seeing my psychologist,"It’s been exactly 6 months since it happened, I know because it’s printed on the ripped piece of paper of a queue number ticket that we’re both probably very acquainted with.

I wanted to write this much earlier but I was swept away with school and my own problems. 

And I could list down a bunch of other reasons too but really, I was just afraid.

-

I came about half an hour early and you were sitting there on the other side of the bench. I didn’t really pay you any attention. I had my ear piece on and was probably listening to Taylor Swift. 

I didn’t even notice you scribbling with a pen  and paper. I didn’t notice you at all.

Right until someone, who I assumed is your mom, came out of the room that I was supposed to go into next.

I pretended not to care right until you and your mom were about to leave and you offered me a folded piece of paper. 

I’ll be honest, I literally thought, “Did she just pass me something to throw away for her?” and it jumped to “Oh, she’s one of those kids.” 

I want you to know, I was really humbled that day when I walked into our psychologist’s room, about to comment about the previous patient only to realize that there was a smiley face drawn on it.

-

I took a long hard look at myself that day but I guessed it only finally clicked when I wrote this down. 

I’m a hypocrite. 

For being afraid of the same kind judgement I cast onto you. Irony, right?

Did you know more than 4 years ago, I was almost sent to a exorcist? It’s funny to look back on. I’m one of the lucky few who had a lot of support from teachers, family and friends.

I saw a post here that talked about how we need to be more receptive to things like therapy.

To not just label people who struggle with their mental health as crazy or to diminish those who actively are seeking help.

p6kfvy,Am I wrong to feel this way?,"My dad wouldnt stop guilt tripping us. I’m 21 just entered the workforce while my 2 other siblings is still studying. 

My sisters is currently living with mum and their step-dad while I live with my dad. It was the worse decision I ever made moving with my dad.  ( we are living in a hdb rental bc he messed his entire life up)

He stopped working for 3 years now bc he wants to rely on government funds and he stopped giving us allowance since we were kids. All of his money that he earned mostly were spend at KTV or some foreign girls that he barely knew. We grew up with having no electricity from time to time bc he didnt bother paying for it. My mum had to get a full time job bc of how irresponsible my dad was.

2 years ago he managed to withdraw all of his cpf out. And guess what, he finished his entire cpf payout in less than a year on ktv girls instead of his kids! ( he managed to lie his way out and im surprised that cpf managed to give him his entire money. He’s only 48 fyi) 

Since then he’s been relying on me to bring food and pay the house bills. I still have 18k uni loans to pay off It’s mentally tiring bc on ocassion he’ll start mentioning he bought baby fomula for us and school textbooks when we were a kid. I wasnt even asked to be born and he’s there nagging at me for not giving him much allowance? It’s absurb that he’s asking for my siblings money as well when they’re working part time barely able to have money throughout the week.

It’s not like I dont give him money often but whenever I give him money, instead of spending it on himself. He’ll spend it on other girls? Which is why I bought grocery instead of starving him. But he wants me to give him money instead. I’m actually considering moving to my bf place bc I dont feel safe in my own house anymore.

xthsf9,Is it right to despise cyclists who cycle at high speeds in pedestrian areas?,"My hatred for them grows every day. I know I'm supposed to love my enemy but my resolve is slipping.

This morning, I was walking back home along an area where there is a bus top and overhead bridge along the park connector. It's quite a narrow pathway. It's no problem if you cycle fast in the park connector itself but I feel like you should slow down a bit when you get to cramped pedestrian areas like this. I'm reminded of those incidents where speeding cyclists/PMD hit and crash into old folks and children.

Anyway, these fuckers just kept speeding through this narrow pedestrian area.

I stared daggers at them, hoping to get a rise out of them. Even though they probably would have whooped my ass as they were bigger than me (Angmohs), I was willing to go down swinging, whether to the hospital or my death, as all the memories and headlines of those speeding fuckers hitting old folks flashed through my mind and my rage increased. Unfortunately, they cycled away unheedingly as if I was just an angry ant.

nrzu9n,"Hating on cycling, POV from a cyclist","After seeing so many hate comments and posts here, I think it's time for a look at cycling in Singapore both from an objective and subjective standpoint. I have been and am all types of ""cyclist"", the casual commuter, the delivery boy and the weekend warrior. My post here is obviously going to be biased towards cycling, so keep that in mind while you're reading the subjective portion. Now let's look at cycling in SG.     
      
**The Facts**      
As of 2017, [1 to 2%](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-why-singapore-has-yet-to-become-a-cycling-paradise-11171774#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20figure%20is%20about,and%20shower%20facilities%20at%20workplaces.)of sgeans cycle as a form of commute. For comparison, it is 1% for USA, 5% for Switzerland, 4% for Norway, 8% for Belgium, 24% for Denmark and 25% for Netherlands. For countries/territories more... similar (thats subjective) to SG, we have Taiwan at 5.1% and Hong Kong at 0.5%. Make what you will with those figures.     
     
Cycling on footpaths is allowed in SG, but only at 10km/h.      
Cycling on Park Connector Networks (PCNs), which includes both dedicated bike lanes and shared paths (for both pedestrians and cyclists), is at 25km/h.     
The average speed of a jogger completing 2.4km in 12mins (you can't even get gold if you're 21) is 12km/h. Something for you to think about.     
Cycling on roads is allowed, contrary to some nutters here who compare cycling on roads to a helicopter landing on an road (which is obviously against the law). 
If you want to ride on the road however, you must follow road rules (obviously) wear a helmet, etc.  
Cycling on expressways and certain tunnels and viaducts however, is strictly forbidden. The full list is [here](https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/onemotoring/home/driving/road_safety_and_vehicle_rules/driving-in-expressway-and-tunnel.html#when_driving_in_expressways&tunnels). Cyclists are allowed on highways (such as Nicoll highway and West Coa","['Until the cyclist population is a significant enough voting bloc, the government is not going to do squat. They can’t even build BTOs to save our ghastly birth rates; one shouldn’t place high expectations on dedicated cycling lanes being a thing lest one disappoints oneself.\n\nMy advise: \n- Learn your terrain and cycle on utmost left of the road. \n- Look over your shoulder for cars frequently and gesture politely using universal hand signals for them to pass so they don’t feel the need to overtake recklessly. \n- Through generally impractical, ride on PCNs if feasible for your own safety.\n\nBTW: I’ve cycled in both east and west. West side is hands down worser off when it comes to infrastructure. Also due to the high amount of construction sites in the west, cyclists ought to cycle with extra care as broken glass, spilled sand, potholes, and small rocks are common on the road.', 'yeah im pretty much like you except I take kembangan PCN to ECP instead of bedok.\n\nso true on the pedestrian part, in overseas I would get screamed at if I wander onto the bike lane and no one ever walks on it. now i just treat PCN as a warm up/balancing exercise as I weave around pedestrians and remind myself not to rush.\n\nthings are so much worse in covid since theres much more jogger and a hell lot more cyclists.\n\nwe escaped alot of hate during the banning of PMDs, but in reality we are no different and are equally as fast and dangerous to pedestrians. \n\nPersonally, i always felt that if you wish to cycle on the road, you need the same equivalent of a Basic Theory Test (either have a Class 2B or Class 3 license)', '> But what we can do is change our mentality. Let\'s be more understanding to each other. At the end of the day, there aren\'t ""cyclists"" or ""drivers"" or ""pedestrians"", merely people. And some people will always be idiots. For those cyclists and drivers who insist on being pricks, show them that actions must have consequences.\n\nFully agreed. We just need to understand and look at everything from various perspectives. And we need to stop addressing people by user groups, and then victimising some, while projecting others as ""villains"". Which is something MSM, Mothership and that SGRV love to do. \n\nJust as we have shitty drivers, we have shitty cyclists, and pedestrians. There\'s not need to keep casting the spotlight on one sector, while pretending there aren\'t bad apples in the other groups. \n\nAll this victimising and demonising just sows discord between user groups. Doesn\'t solve the problem, which is a lack of courtesy/""give and take"" from everyone. And the ""ownership"" mindset some individuals have.\n\nExample: In February, I was on the Ulu Pandan PCN one Saturday evening. The PCN had been recently divided into a cyclist and pedestrian lane at the time. There was a parent with her kid on a push tricycle. I overtook her from the left on the cycling lane, as she was on the right side, and didn\'t want to intrude into the pedestrian side. As I got closer to her, I went: ""Hi, coming on your left."" As I passed her at a low speed (sub 10km/h), she went: ""All this cyclists...Why are these people cycling here. It\'s the pedestrian lane."" I replied: ""Err it\'s actually the cycling lane."" She then went: ""Oh err sorry. I saw wrongly."" I told her no worries and wished her a good evening. \n\nI honestly don\'t have an issue with pedestrians on the cycling lane of the PCN, and I just slow down when approaching them. The only problem I have is when they happily decide to hog the whole pathway, or stray on the path and decide to behave in an aggressive manner to those trying to overtake the', ""Oh my god, the amount of cycling vs pedestrian vs car riding threads lately.\n\nAs someone who runs, cycles and can drive, THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND where everyone just follows the basic rules and act like human beings and treats everyone on the road (regardless of what apparatus they're on top of or enclosed in) with respect.\n\nIf you're cycling, just slow the fuck down when you're cycling on footpaths and there's a pedestrian in front. Go around them slowly then pick up pace again.\n\nIf you're driving and you see a cyclist, same. Slow the fuck down, go around them and pick up pace again. And cyclists on the road, stay on the last lane (i.e. left most lane) whenever possible and try to make yourself as less of a nuisance as possible."", 'I just want to rant: as someone that cycles, I rlly hate the fked up cyclists.

Wtf?\n\nPedestrians are easier to manoeuvre around and usually have some form of situational awareness. ECP PCN are full of people that ride halfway will suddenly stop in the middle of the bike lane for no reason. No warning whatsoever.

1st TP 

•  Emergency brake sometime you can wait awhile before you cancel the signal then move on. I did everything so fast minus 2 points 

•  Parking wise please ensure you look carefully I at parallel parking I strike kerb x2 

•  For directional change also. Look carefully I also strike kerb 

•  Please make sure you turn to the correct lane as minus 4 points very painful 

•  Check blind spot hor 

Total : - 48 

2nd TP 

•  Please ensure that really clear to go then go if not they will minus 4 point (I was told by my instructor that I too safe liao so I look 1 more time and then move out become people stop for me so I cause safety issue)

j1wlxq,We need to talk about the horribly corrupt RENOVATION / ID INDUSTRY in Singapore,"The issues homeowners face from our local renovation industry are not being discussed enough online. There are a ton of under the table deals at the expense of homeowners, zero regulation and a lot of scams homeowners have to dodge. It should not be this hard for the average Singaporean to renovate a home. Things need to change in this industry.

IDs don't require to go through any courses or get certifications before they become IDs. This is different from for e.g the real estate industry where you have to register with CEA and wear your tag whenever you are on-site. Or the financial industry where a business may need MAS regulation. For IDs, anyone can call themselves one, start a company and the moment there is a disupute, close down / run away with the deposit / start a new company. There are many such reported cases in the papers.

But what I want to talk about here is the under the table relationship between IDs and suppliers that many Singaporeans are not aware of. Because homeowners like us will never know the real prices of materials, we will always be vulnerable to shady IDs and contractors. Because of the lack of regulation, there is nothing to stop IDs from overcharging as they please. Or even suppliers overcharging customers (us homeowners) when we try to manage the process directly.

We may even be thinking we're getting a good deal when we're not. Think of the Tuk Tuk's in BKK that camp outside a tourist spot in a cartel-like manner to jack up prices together or the taxi mafia that prevents Grab drivers from coming in to pick up tourists. Sure, you can get market rates if you walk 1km+ out with your luggage to the open road and try your luck there. But it should NOT be that way.

I am sharing my experience with a recent interior designer (ID) because what happened to us is very common in the industry and we should talk about it and push for change.

**Why it is difficult for the average homeowner:**

* The ID I worked with has just two people (project","[""As someone working in a very related industry, never ever go for the cheapest contractor. \n\n\nI used to want to go for the cheapest contractor till I started working with them personally. Learnt my lesson and I'll never save $$ when it comes to a contractor, especially my own house."", ""Definitely dishonest of ur ID to say there's no mark-up but I think the reason why there's almost no complains is because many homeowners kind of expect IDs to work that way-at least I do. You can consult with the contractor yourself but it would be tedious.\n\nDon't think it's a criminal offence to mark-up prices. Middle man always mark up prices, no matter what they say. So not sure if I would label that as a corrupt practice unless if it involves bribery."", 'Every ID we asked quoted us 80k and upwards for reno of a 4rm resale as a benchmark without going through the designs.\n\nManaged to find a contractor who did everything from carpentry to electrical and plumbing. Even helped us source the fixtures. We saved a a very significant amount.\n\nDefinitely have some micromanaging but nothing impossible.', ""You got a shitty ID lor. TBH, ID shopping is something one should do and if they don't give invoice or they say they don't earn markups or commission, they must be lying lol.\n\nHonestly, if you really want to reduce the cost and still get an ID, then you will need to find your own suppliers, buy from them and then let your ID project manage.\n\nActually, what I don't get is usually if you have a more or less fixed idea of what you want the ID to do, the price quoted is usually around that ball park. If it balloons, it is usually because the client wants to add more stuff into the house"", 'You can, engage, negotiate, monitor contractors yourself. You can go to suppliers yourself to buy the items that you want, then let your contractors do the jobs only.', 'You found the ID to be shady from the start ($15k upfront) and you continued with them? Did you find them on a website starting with the letter Q?\n\nThere are bad hats in every industry, you have to do your due diligence in comparing quotes and short listing IDs. \n\nFor material shortlisting - this is standard middleman fee. That’s why you requested for itemized cost and do comparisons on BOM and exercise your due diligence. \n\nI don’t know what recourse you are looking for now if you have already paid them all the fees and did not withheld any for dispute?', 'The Holy trinity of shady jobs in sg:\n \n Interior designer \n\n Insurance agent\n\n Wedding planners', 'Haha welcome to the renovation industry. As a sub contractor, we do under table agreements with IDs. It is a common practice. \n\nYou don’t want to be conned then oversee the entire process yourself. IDs will markup left and right until owners also don’t know one.', 'We also heard of ID marking up prices, so we engaged our own contractors and carpenters. Only engaged an ID to do the design and rendering. Overall, I would say I saved a bit of money (37k all in for 2 bed + study resale condo) but we spent most of our weekends handling the renovation, looking for materials and lights, etc. It’s really about how much time you want to commit vs convenience.', 'As someone from the build environment industry, I feel the crux of the problem lies in the lack of certification or profession practice in ID as an industry. \n\nArchitects, Landscape Architects, Engineers, they are all govern by a profession code and certification. Interior Designers don\'t, and as such any Tom Dick or Harry who think they have a inkling of design aesthetic, can be called an Interior designer. And sometimes, these idiots can\'t tell you the difference between a load bearing/non load column/wall. \nAnd don\'t get me started on the whole ""minimalist"" fad going on now', 'I mean, I sympathise, I really do. But you are basically complaining that you paid too much for a shitty ID and are demanding ""regulation"". \n\nWhat regulation are you looking for? This is what the market is like. This is why you need to ID shop (compare between IDs), bargain with the ID (be insistent, be thick skinned, demand everything in writing), be prepared to walk if you can\'t get what you want, inspect all of the work as and when it is done, demand invoices for everything. Push, push, push back right at them.\n\nEverybody is hustling to make that sale. The ID *must* eat a profit, else they go out of business. How much of a profit they make is partly up to you. Don\'t give in. Be persistent. \n\nI am sorry nobody taught you this lesson before you had to learn it directly yourself with your hard earned money on your new home, souring that new home feel and what ought to have been a happy occasion of renovation completion. I totally sympathise, I know it must feel terrible. \n\nThe most important thing right now is to *inspect and document the work they have done for you*. Make sure it is in line with what they quoted. If the work is done, which is what it sounds like, inspect and use everything, make sure it works. Take photos - not just of the working things but of all the things. Hopefully it is all working and good. Hopefully you had the presence of mind to keep track of things as they were working on your home. Do you know where they laid new pipe? New power points? Make sure you know and jot it down somewhere.', ""Am an interior designer (ID) myself, in fact I've recently started my own company. \n\nJust want to emphasize that I'm not here to advertise my company or anything like that. And I'm also aware of the stigma attached to IDs.\n\n But truthfully speaking the main point to me has always been making sure the client/homeowners move in happily. That's what I love about my job. Seeing my clients move in happily with their significant other into their first home. Or helping an older couple spruce up their retirement home.\nThese moments are what make the job a fulfilling one. \n\nMoving on, I don't want to take sides but personally I don't agree with the way your ID handled things based on what you mentioned. While yes, of course she has a right to earn she had already done that through the 15k project management fee which is a lot in my opinion. But of course depends on what type of works you did and type of home it is.\nThe whole invoice shenanigans is honestly just plain misleading. It was just a ruse, and a really sly one at that. \n\nThat being said, of course I mark up lah haha. I too have to feed my family. And also after all it's a creative process where I pour in hours upon hours of designing, planning, coordinating and executing. But I just mark up. No project management fee. The mark up is what I earn. The project management is part of my job. It justifies the mark up. \n\nAnd I read a comment that said IDs earn about 45%? While I'm sure some do. I can assure you that definitely not all do. That's like insane for the average consumer. I won't reveal what I mark up. But it ain't 45%. \n\nYes there are IDs out there simply looking to make a quick buck. But there are IDs out there who are also sincere and earnest.\n\nTo me I'd rather do my best for my client so that I can photoshoot the home and add it to my portfolio. Plus a job well done usually also means referrals and a good review. It's a win-win situation for everyone this way. \n\nPlease feel free to let me know if you have an"", ""Recently joined this Industry so I'll like to share a bit on what I have encountered and learnt. Initially, I applied as a tradesman. Figured I do carpentry which is something I do quite enjoy. The Covid situation did quite a number on every industry and so it didnt happen. Then I came across my friend post looking for people to join him and now im ID/contracter/handyman.  \n\nFirst of all Id like to talk a little bit on marking up. Im sure most of you have seen items such as loading and unloading, Area protection, disposal of debris and so on. These are actually being used as it is, unfortunately sometimes things go wrong such as materials too big to fit into the lift, 1 floor up is $10 and if you live on the 15th floor that is easily 150 for every item that has to be manually carried up. Of course as a consumer nobody likes to hear things like oh we had to pay extra for this cost comes back to you so end up most of the time ID firms eat this cost. So typically they mark up is to cover for these kind of scenario but if you are experienced enough, all of these would have been planned (Project management skills here!) So I can see why some ID do charge on Project management, but looking at your case where you are charged both PM and markup, then yea you have been carroted.\n\nOn using your own subcons and buying of miscellaneous. Quite frankly it is more of a matter of convenience to me although I do hear of stories from subcons of how ID markup their services. But the main point is this. If you happen to buy an oven with one of our suppliers and it dosent fit, then we can easily change it, if you do on your own then that is where the headache comes. Although flexibility is important and I always tell my clients if you dont see anything that fits what you like then please do check out other options. At the end of the day, it is a home that they will come back to and it is important that they are happy with it.\n\nNext thing I want to talk about is quotation. I am not afrai"", ""This is not just present in the ID industry, but actually everywhere you go. Not defending the ID in any way, but this is how businesses operate to maximise profit.\n\nLet's say you wish to renovate your house with such and such fittings. I quote you 30k for it and you agree to the price. It doesn't matter if I manage to find a contractor to do it for 20k or even 10k or 1k, it is then by my own merit that I'm able to source for cheap alternatives. Ultimately, so long as I am able to provide whatever is stated in the contract, that's all that matters.\n\nAnd as others mentioned, you are paying for the convenience of having someone manage that for you. It is the reason why such middlemen even exists in the first place.""]"
bh61ru,"Jewel Changi Airport Food, with better categories","Not sponsored. For the foodies who prefer unique experiences, better categorized. Made so foreigners don’t go reading “best Jewel Changi Airport food” articles and think only fast food options like A&W, Shake Shack and Pink Fish are worth eating in Jewel Changi.

While reporters, journalists, bloggers and Instagrammers swamp to the new Jewel Changi Airport reporting news about long queues for A&W, selected lists of eateries, and first looks to jump on the hype train, I’m taking a slower approach to bring you the real dining guide to maximizing your visit to Jewel by listing the directory of 112 dining options into better categories.

Disclaimer: Again, not sponsored, but I am a food blogger/writer wanna-be. I wrote a few articles researching the origins of certain foods.

# Categorizing Method

I try to use community based reviews to support building this list. Within each category it’s arranged alphabetical order.

For Michelin awarded stalls: The awards don’t belong to the brand, but is given to only one of the stores. Since these stores all newly opened, any Michelin award refers to the other branch. Whether this translates to the store here is another matter.

1acw78z,Guide on getting a PPCDL Boat License,"Hi everyone! I've seen many driving license guides but negligible ones for PPCDL (rightfully so, since much lesser people actually want to drive a boat). Therefore, I decided to write a comprehensive guide to any sailor wannabes. A PPCDL is for anyone at least 16 years old to drive a powered pleasure craft of up to 24m in length.

*Point to note: I took my lessons at RSYC and my learning experience might differ from yours if you took it at different centres.*

# Step 1 - Enroll for lessons at a PPCDL centre

There are 9 approved centres based on MPA's website [here](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/port-marine-ops/harbourcraft-and-pleasure-craft-regulations/licensing-of-pleasure-craft). You will need to enroll for their PPCDL course and complete the entire course (2-4 days worth of theory AND practical lessons) before they will give you a certificate of attendance.

At RSYC, they have an elearning platform with quite decent teaching materials on the syllabus. To the extent that I felt that going for the theory lessons in person were mostly a waste of time. But of course, since most students don't bother to watch the elearnings prior, the irl theory lessons would thus be crucial. The lessons' slides and coursebook are also available for download. Depending on the instructor (and the students if they don't ask too many questions), the theory lesson might end earlier than scheduled. A 1h lunch break is also included. *At RSYC, you can pay more for the club food, walk to nearby Mcdonalds or walk to supper stretch near NUS.*

One good thing is that they provide 9 sets of practice questions (although I believe 2-3 questions have the wrong answers). But RSYC deactivates your account after 1 month, with a free one-time re-activation for 3 days. After that, they charge $16+ per month. I had to go through the trouble to scour the Internet for more questions and included some of my theory questions in my own question bank so that I can spam practice questions.

For my practical lesson, ","['Boat lessons, esp the theory was the hardest compared to my class 2b and class 3. The theory notes I had was inadequate and I  had to refer to UNCLOS to fully understand. Taking extra practical session before practical test was worth it. I did one extra lesson.\n\nDuring practical test, the tester took 3 of us students out. I was the only one who passed. The other 2 died at coming alongside cos they struck the  jetty.', 'police coast guard. free training and free ppdcl.']"

fm41s6,"Why downloading TraceTogether not only makes sense, but is the right thing to do.","Hi everyone, I've been thinking about lots of the assumptions behind this app and the technologies which enable it to work, as well as the effectiveness of the proposal. I've come to several key conclusions.



**Privacy**: The logic of this app is that it does not geo-locate or give away any identifiable information. While I did not develop the app, I do understand the principles behind it. It will drop 'handshake tokens' to other bluetooth enabled devices, within its range of 10 meters, which are encrypted. Now why should we be unafraid of this app?

* A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

* B. Duration of contact and proximity to other users. Note that it does not track where you visit. Even if you've been going to some less than desirable places, even if the police wanted to catch you out for visiting a red light district, they CANNOT find this information out from this app. You could have met the person who was infected on the bus, plane, train, car, whatever it is, it only reveals connections and not places. This proximity data is similarly encrypted, which all provides the same level of protection as previous mentioned above. If we take the government at their word, and the apple store with their policies and tight protection concerns about their users, we can very safely assume, short of some global conspiracy where Singapore's government is the FBI,CIA,FSB,NSA,Chinese Intelligence, GIGN, and all other intelligence agencies rolled into one, that we cannot have this information be leaked. 

* C. It cannot phone home to a central server. All information is kept on your device until the special PIN is ","['Hey OP\n\nAs someone who has no knowledge about such tech, just wanna say thanks for taking the time to explain the app and encourage adoption.\n\nOne qn I have is, once COVID19 blows over and I delete the app/remove permissions - will it be comepletely removed from my mobile and close the doors on any potential dataflow from that point onwards?', 'Given the number of data leaks in recent months from health records to blood donator data, it is not far fetched for people to be worried about such apps and data collection. \n\nFurthermore, the app uses workarounds to circumvent Apple restrictions and limitations on tracking data. \n\nAlso, how accurate is this setup? There was no mention of it. \n\nThere is no 3rd party testing or certification, Nor is the developer willing to share in detail what is being collected and how they intend to use it. There is also no mention of the data collected will be purged after x months and whether it will be shared across with other agencies. \n\nIt is one thing to trust the Govt, and another leap of faith to install a permanent app in the phone collecting data all the time.', ""The constant notification being there is annoying tho.\n\nCan't they perhaps send the notification only when the app crash?"", 'Is the code open source? Failing data privacy, or simply opening a breach does also happen by mistake.', 'After reading the whole thread and OP\'s replies, I\'ve found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.\n\nFirstly,\n\n>A.

For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.\n\nFurthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn\'t really that hard to do, and won\'t take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.\n\nOP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn\'t anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).\n\nBuilding on what I\'ve said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.\n\nOP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:\n\n>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups', 'No open source no talk. If they are really trying to help, just make it open source la stop being so typical and try to make a proprietary tracking/reporting app under their ""HIVE"" initiative. It\'s not something special and people already stigmatize against apps like SGSecure so why go on and repeat the same mess?', ""An always on Bluetooth radio on my phone polling every few ticks, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that.\n\nYou may be under the impression that since leaving GPS and Bluetooth on doesn't drain your battery much compared to when it's off.

witz8g,Consequences for NS Defaulter,"I am asking on behalf of a friend.

Friend's info:

24 yo M. Sg-born Sg citizen. Completed primary school in Sg. 

At age 13, he left Sg for Canada, together with his parents. He did not apply for exit permit when he left.

At age 16, they received a letter from MINDEF, telling them to apply for pre-enlistee Exit Permit. In order to apply for the permit, they need to show proof that he was attending school in Canada and they needed to pay a bond (S$75,000 or an amount equivalent to 50% of the combined annual gross income of both your parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher). Parents refused to pay the bond because they were worried that he would change his mind, and not return to Sg after his high school studies (If he did not return to serve NS, they would lose the deposit). 

At age 18, my friend decided that he wanted to return to Sg. When he wrote to MINDEF to explain his circumstance, they replied that he was already deemed an NS defaulter, and he was advised to return to Sg to ""face the music"". He was too afraid of the ""music"", so he did not return. His Sg passport subsequently expired and he needed to have a valid passport for travel, so he applied for Canadian citizenship, which he successfully obtained. 

He went on to complete his undergrad in Canada. After that, he went to the US for employment. To save on taxes, he applied for US citizenship and became a dual US-Canadian citizen (US taxes are lower than Canadian taxes, and dual citizens pay the lower of the two countries' taxes). He is currently working and residing in the US. He also changed his first and last name, and is now holding a valid US passport. 

Questions he has:

1. What are the consequences if he returns to Sg now for a recreational visit? Note that should he choose to return, he shall be using his current, valid US passport, with a different first and last names. Will ICA/MINDEF be able to find out that he was an NS defaulter?
2. What if he returns to Sg after age 40? Will the","[""I think this is way above asksg's paygrade, but the general rule of thunb is that as long as he did not register for NS and then did not enlist without Mindef approval, he will be labeled as a defaulter. ICA has its own means of detecting whether someone is a defaulter at the checkpoints, so best not to take the risk.\n\nAs for the parents, I don't think there is a law that charges the parents for not.paying the bond (someone else can correct me if I'm wrong), but usually matters like these is the reason you keep seeing people elsewhere complaining that their parents screwed up their chances of returning to SG"", 'I understand that he will be arrested once he lands in Singapore soil. This includes emergency stopovers and flight transfer, much lest recreational visit. \n\nThis sound similar to your friend’s situation. \n[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-has-jail-term-increased-13-months-after-appeal-792696](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-has-jail-term-increased-13-months-after-appeal-792696)\n\nAnd this case, with the change in citizenship. [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-who-stayed-outside-singapore-without-permit-more-8-years-gets-jail-653386](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-who-stayed-outside-singapore-without-permit-more-8-years-gets-jail-653386)', 'I was involved in the case of an SAF deserter who decided to return to SG after >5 years of residing in China with his spouse.\nThey arrested him at Arrival, and processed him into Detention Barracks the following day.', 'Yea, don’t come back, prison first then detention barracks.', 'I was a regimentation and discipline (R&D) clerk during my NS and handled AWOL cases. Can confidently say that your friend will definitely face jail time if he returns. Deserters (long-term AWOL) have very little room for mitigation as compared to short term AWOLees, and the standard procedure would be a court martial under military court (can’t remember if civil court is involved as a separate process or not but someone else in the comments mentioned it).\n\nICA records and SAF records are definitely linked to an extent as we had to use travel records to determine the legitimacy of some claims made by AWOL servicemen.\n\nThe way I see it, if your friend wants to maintain ANY ties with Singapore at all moving forward, he would need to come back and clean up this mess, although he’ll have to suffer the consequences and I think most would be unwilling to do that.\n\nIf he’s unwilling to be put through the consequences, then he should be mentally aware that he will forever be unable to maintain any ties with the country.', 'So US passports have a field that says ""Place of birth"".\n\nWhen he enters SG with that passport and it says ""Place of birth: Singapore"", I\'m pretty sure he\'ll get some interesting questions after that.\n\nCanadian passports makes that field optional, but apparently that can cause more questions at the border.', ""Don't come back lol, he would most likely be arrested and jailed"", '[deleted]', '1) Yes. ICA has a list of people to look out for in their computer system. Which means when your “friend” present his passport at immigration, the computer will flag him up. Remember, Singapore and Canada has a visa free agreement. Which also means basic details are shared. Which also means names and alias are known…\n\n2) The longer you stay away from Singapore, the longer the jail term. So yes, consequences are different. Just much much worse.\n\n3) depends on how good the lawyer is… and if it’s at the civilian or military courts…\n\n4) Not likely.\n\nThe key point to remember, sg male citizens are forced to serve. So they will make an example of anyone that escaped the “system” to ensure there’s no one would attempt it.\n\nIt’s also why Kevin Kwan cannot attend the Crazy rich asian gala in Singapore. Even thou he wrote the book.', 'Question: \n\n1. What are the consequences if he returns to Sg now for a recreational visit? Note that should he choose to return, he shall be using his current, valid US passport, with a different first and last names. Will ICA/MINDEF be able to find out that he was an NS defaulter?\n2. What if he returns to Sg after age 40? Will there be different consequences compared to 1?\n3. In his defence, he stated that it was his parents that did not pay the bond, and that they left him with no choice. Will MINDEF grant him any leniency?\n4. Did his parents commit any offence under the Sg law when they refused to pay the bond? If so, what are the consequences if his parents choose to return to Sg?\n\nAnswer:\n1. He will be arrested regardless of passport he is using. Regardless what first and last name, the glaring point is his age, birthdate and place of birth which will lead to further investigation.  The only luck is he must be very sure SG don\'t have his biometrics. But birth cert will just give all away.\n\nOne of the questions immigration will ask if he ever entered Singapore with a different name. Answering ""No"" is just an additional offence.\n\n2. After 40, the punishment for defaulting with be more serious. The court has established a guideline for this.\n\n3. No defence. Moreover your friend emailed Mindef at 18 years old, that was the only time he could expect leniency if he immediately go back to serve, chances are he might not be charged since he served army at 18. Your friend knew but chose not to go back.\n\n4. Nothing will happen to parents. The offender here is the NS liable person.', ""1) Jail.\r  \n2) Jail.\r  \n3) Jail.\r  \n4) They will not be charged.\n\n\r[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/lawyer-tan-chee-mengs-son-gets-12-weeks-jail-after-defaulting-on-ns](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/lawyer-tan-chee-mengs-son-gets-12-weeks-jail-after-defaulting-on-ns)\n\n\rThe ones facing the consequences are the children.\n\n\rSo don't come back. \r  \n\r  \nYou can be arrested at any time while in Singapore. How is having this over your head all the time be a recreational visit?"", 'If he comes back and gets caught. He will be charged and if found guilty he will be jailed. He may have to serve NS if he is young enough', 'Why want to come back sg leh? Eat good food ah? Tell ur friend penang fried kuey teow better. If he didnt dare to face the music back then, now suddenly dare to face the music? But honestly, i dont think anyone here knows the answer. Only way is for your friend to try his luck and come in SG and find out. Dont forget to update reddit so thst we can create a mini wiki for future defaulters.', 'Just don’t come to Singapore. Unless he wants to get caught. Lol you already used the benefits till you left the country, didn’t serve NS or paid the bond. I don’t think there’s any leniency in this. Go figure', 'Why don\'t you email MINDEF about this? Get it from the official source!\n\nImagine some years down the road your friend did some silly petty crime unrelated to NS but told the police something like ""Oh Reddit said it was legal to do it"". \n\n\nLMAO.', 'I think it’ll be too much of a risk. When applying for Canadian citizenship, won’t your friend need to present his current passport (SG) and identification card?\n\nAnd if I recall correctly, for US citizenship, they ask for birth certificate. So probably your friend has to provide the SG birth certificate. \n\nI don’t know how well SG customs systems are but seems like a risk if they are sending info back to SG and may be able detect him at the customs.', ""Just don't come back! That's alot of money to risk too for the parents! \n\nNothing here to come back to anywhos, just stay over there."", ""don't come back. singapore has nothing anyway lol"", '[deleted]', ""Why would you even come back honestly? Not to shit on Singapore but the only plausible reason why someone would want to visit Singapore would be business or something. There's so many other countries that have everything Singapore does. He will get arrested. He would be stupid to come back.""]"
uqp8ui,In light of the recent discourse over NS and whether women should serve:,"So a year ago, i made a post here asking men what kind of injuries they sustained during NS or during reservist, and there were a lot of horror stories shared there (I’ll link the post in the comments since we can’t share archived links in the post)

I’ve seen plenty of rather nasty rhetoric over men being too whiny, so i thought I’d do this again this year to highlight the fact that a lot of injuries go unreported and untreated during our 2 years, and it’s not as easy as “just two years”. 

I’ll go first: tore my meniscus in the left knee while on 16km route march in SCS, subsequently posted back to my unit as HQ clerk. Served in an admin role but was still required to go outfield to support the units mission planning. Ended up tearing the ACLs in both knees (80% torn left knee, 50% torn right knee). Went for surgery on my left knee, and now I’m recovered and back to doing sports, albeit having to wear ACL knee guards on both knees to prevent further injuries. 

What’s your NS injury story?","['Almost the same story as OP, I dislodged my meniscus during BMT. \n\nWas sent to MO, got yelled at by MO and accused of malingering. \n\nMO got ass kicked by officers who saw my kneecap’s very appetizing new position at the side of my knee.\n\nMO refused to down pes, claiming that I must tear my meniscus to down pes. \n\nMO also could not allow me to continue training because I would tear my meniscus if training continued. \n\nThrown into clerk as Pes B, ORDed as Pes B clerk. Actively discouraged from filing service injury.\n\n Now I get to deal with constant calls to do IPPT that I’m not definitely not fit to do (I can’t even run), and I have to queue for hours at the bloody MO to get the same piece of paper saying I can’t run, every single time.', 'Using a throwaway account, for reasons that will be explained below.\n\nIn March 2019, I made a post on the NS injury down PES and financial compensation process.\n\nLink:  https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/b8j9i0/a\\_guide\\_to\\_ns\\_injuries\\_compensation\\_process/\n\nI did this as I suffered a severe injury myself, that left me unable to walk for two weeks due to repeated breaches of safety rules. The process of down-PES, getting the service injury, and financial compensation was a nightmare and a black box to effectively everyone, with all sorts of rules and departments throwing injured servicemen around. I saw myself how many NSFs were not able to claim their rightful compensation and service injury coverage because they simply did not know their rights or the process. I was fortunate enough, as a admin commander, and through knowing the correct clerks to understand the process and assist others.\n\nAfter posting my guide in March 2019, I would receive PMs on a regular basis of NSFs requesting help on how they could get service injury coverage, and to hear their stories was heartbreaking cos I could only guide them and not assist them in any more meaningful manner.\n\nThis would stop in June 2020 (think carefully of what was held in Singapore then), when I got a call from MINDEF asking me if I could remove the post as they did not want the information to be this transparent. I simply deleted the account, but left the post up. None of the information is secret, as I simply pieced the puzzle, and I made pains to ensure no confidential info was pit up. This is the moment that enrages and makes me lose all hope in our institutions, as they bothered to spend the effort to track me down and request taking down information that so many of us needed, but did not bother to fix the underlying issues that caused them, leaving thousands of us injured and financially disadvantaged.\n\nFor all their rhetoric, they clearly do not care about the welfare of Singaporean men, we are j', 'My friends headphone earplug thingy came out during live firing and he now has permanent hearing loss . He’s a huge audiophile so it really made him depressed . \n\nHe also tore his ankle ligaments , he had to put the metal stuff to support his ankle and he can’t rotate his feet anymore.', 'Served under Presidential Guards/Silent Precision Drill Squad. \n\nDeveloped Achilles Tendonitis in both ankles (from prolonged standing/marching/drilling) and ganglion cysts on my left wrist (from trauma/overexertion of wrists during rifle drills). \n\nThese conditions only manifested shortly after my ORD. Like I always tell my juniors, 2 years only, try to avoid injuries at all costs.', '[deleted]', ""Hey OP, your post got me thinking. Do you think a long term medical support plan for people who served be something that's of interest to NSMen in general? Beyond the service injury card or the CPF medisave top ups.\n\nI didn't face much physical injury during my service, but I've met lots whose injuries started or were aggravated during service, especially lower back and leg related injuries. I also feel like some injuries would only present symptoms or show signs much later after ORD, like my ankle. It was minor and definitely got worse during NS, but it only gets too painful occasionally. They can get passed off as just a typical strain, but now my ankle feels like it can just give way anytime as I get older lol."", ""**LOL I had a fungal infection on my groin area.**\n\nOkay so,\n\nIt is evident across almost like, 10 threads that it is unlikely that women and NS will change from leadership level\n\nORD alr, try to get out of reservist\n\nServing or haven't serve just chaokeng\n\nClaw back your time and do all you can to upskill and stay competitive in society or keep your current position. Whoever you blame didn't directly cause this. If buay song just pwn lor. Social media is a great equalizer. Just see how many have been taken down by the power of social media."", 'My number one priority when enlisting was to make sure that I don’t get any long-term injuries. They’re already taking 2 years (+10 cycles), I’m not letting them take a lifetime of health and wellbeing. \n\nEnded up being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, so I guess I technically achieved my goal.', ""I went in with mild depression that was so minor I ignored it for years, to severe depression, social anxiety, my first and luckily only near-suicidal experience, and thank god of all places I got posted to, it was a relatively chill place where I don't get fked for the stupidest reasons.\n\nMost of these came from BMT, when some asshats in my section decide to form a clique and bully the rest of us for being less than hypercompetent. I was good enough to help out and not be incompetent. I had some minor problems with the sergeants, two of them being extremely strict but at least not completely unreasonable, though they have brought me to tears a few times (which is still too much imo). But my section mates berate me for sleeping with my locker opened (lock was on, but not locked, so unnoticable at a glance) when they did the exact same thing. I literally saw them go to sleep, some with their lockers wide open. I just had the misfortune of no one watching my back when I did the same thing, and they stole my rifle and hid it in their locker. Only when I went down to talk to the sergeants did they come and stop me mid-conversation, because they don't want to be punished for what they did.\n\nThose assholes can rot in hell. I developed so much anxiety from that and other incidents that I never truly recovered from, only adapted to after years away from NS. My mental health was in shambles and I almost became the 3rd NSF to shoot myself in a month because I just wanted to end it all. Super damn easy when I was in charge of holding the keys to the bullets and rifle cabinet, and I told myself if any single bad thing happened that day, it was go time. Thankfully, everyone in my post was so much better than my BMT shithead section mates, my mistakes were forgiven and they helped cover my ass instead of blasting it and by the 12th hour in my 24 hour shift, I was somewhat better and decided I was going to be OK that day. I honestly felt like the entire world was greyscaled and I "", 'As mentioned here. The mental health impact of NS cannot be underestimated. \n\nDuring the days of the founding of NS, mental health isn’t a topic well understood. And even today, our culture does not really understand mental health much dismissing it as just being weak. \n\nI’ve seen people who graduated from poly with high hopes of furthering their studies and achieving much in life only for the 2 years road bump to break them down relegating them to menial roles. \n\nYes. I understand that there are people who continues to be successful after NS but not everyone is mentally strong enough to continue doing so. \n\nNot everyone is mentally stable enough to be in such a regimental place. And the lack of manpower has continued to pushed people who should have gotten a PES F for their mental health issue into admin role and some in combat role with a gun. \n\nI would not be surprise if we hear a case or two of people committing suicide while in NS.', 'Mostly mental. I went in as a happy 18 year old with no mental health issues and came out with quite a number.\n\nI remembered people telling me it\'s good to go because you\'ll ""learn to be a real man"" and meet new people. \nI did not feel any more manly and I did not make any friends. I despised my 2 years thrown away for something that barely yielded anything for my benefit.', ""I want to bring to attention the mental toll and issues that comes with serving as well. A significant amount of enlistees struggle with anxiety and depression from having two years taken away. Those with 5 days in camp and 2 out also struggle a lot with having a social lifestyle. Their friends are either in uni or unable to meet up which causes loneliness. Romantic pursuits are much more difficult as well. The sacrifice of enlistees are not something to be understated. A lot of these mental issues can last post ORD or become lifelong especially those with genetic triggers or susceptible to depression/anxiety. There's no proper compensation or support for mental illness post ORD.\n\nPlease note my comments are anecdotal and not scientifically/statistically backed up."", 'I smashed my knees into the low wall multiple times during SOC during BMT. My knee hurt so much afterwards that I was on crutches for a week. When I posted to my unit, my knee continued to hurt more and I went to see a specialist. \n\nI was diagnosed with chronic quadriceps tendinitis. MRI scans showed little to no cartilage in my knees. Immediately my PES was dropped to B4 and I was permanently excused from RMJ and Lower Limbs. I only ORDed on 19 April 2022. I initially wanted to sign on but because of my condition, I can’t go into my vocation as a spec or officer (Army Int). \n\nNow whenever I walk or run for long periods of time my knee hurts. I’m working part-time in retail now and at the end of the day my knee hurts because I stand around a lot. Sometimes I’m limping when I go to the storeroom. \n\nIt’s not just 2 years. I cannot stand it when people say it. I am proud of my service but some people really need to shut the fuck up. I get into arguments with my mother about how shitty the pay is. It’s funny because she keeps trying to rationalize it as a form of service when she hasn’t done a single day of NS. She keeps saying “oh a US Marine has it worse because he actually goes off to war.” My rationale in response is that he has a choice to go into the Marines and is paid a decent wage while I’m not. I also bring up the point that I *wanted* to sign on. \n\nI’m leaving for university in the UK soon and I’ve only just made up my mind that I’ll do my best to stay there and find a job. I don’t want to come back to a society that treats me like shit. As far as I’m concerned, equal rights means equal *rights*. Everyone is conscripted or no one is.\n\nAnd my mother can wonder why every single guy I know complains about NS.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that when I went to see the MO the first time for my knee, he low-key accused me of malingering and asked if I was doing it to get out of IPPT. Luckily, I had a command team that actually backed me up. My OCs and SM were genuinely', 'I tore a ligament and went through surgery. It took me months to recover but never the same anymore.\nI known one of them who went to Aceh to help out for the 2004 tsunami and came back a different man as in a bad way.', 'Not mine, but my friend crushed his invertebral discs because he was in a vocation that involved carrying heavy loads in the field. Permanent damage.\n\nCome to think of it, 3 of my friends have the same injury, all in different combat vocations but all involve carrying/maneuvering heavy loads in the field.', ""I was in Tekong for exercise, carrying 84 manpack, fell with my leg straightened, torn my ACL (half torn). That's not the bad part.\n\nI had to hobble to the main road, and then the RSM had a look at me, saw that I could still stand up (nobody knew it was ACL until we reached the medical centre), refused to let me go in the rover, so I had to walk about 2km to where we ended the exercise, despite having a busted leg. This took 2 hours, I was helped by 2 people from my section, someone found a huge stick for me to use as a walking stick, while a few others had to carry all our gear (this is all 84 so I'd say about 120kg of extra load for those poor people as well).\n\nThat's the drama one. I also had a back injury (later diagnosed as a compressed disc in my lower back) due to constantly having to carry these heavy loads (mainly 84, but also SPIKE and MG on occasion). Many times, since people being unwell is a common thing for us heavy weapons people, we often had to carry other people's loads, which meant that pretty much everyone had some sort of back problem.\n\nOnce during a 24km route march (once again carrying the manpack), I had heat exhaustion. The medic failed to find my veins, so after poking both my arms twice each he gave up and I just drank some 100 Plus.\n\nTo end off with a less serious and more whiny one, during the search for MSK, we had long days of heavy rain and bashing through actual swamps (did you know we have so much swamps in Singapore? I didn't!), which meant that we had a full week of damp boots, naturally leading to severe foot rot for pretty much all of us to varying degrees. When we went back to camp, our boots were all stuffed with newspaper to dry them, but they're not dry at all when we have to wear them again, because of the short turnaround. We often reached back in camp around 10pm, sleep around 11pm, wake up 4.30am, out we went again. To add on the whiny bit, some days we had to do cordon at night, which meant out in the forests all night,"", 'Since this is a serious flaired discussion, will share more about my experience.\n\nDuring my time in army I sustained moderate to severe hearing loss after live firing exercises. Currently have to wear hearing aids for the rest of my life, since you can’t recover hearing loss. Had to downpes and also suffered from the whole “vocation to promote” bullshit. \n\nSo what happens in the army in terms of promotion, if you are just a normal private->LCP->CPL guy. Once you are assigned to a unit/vocation, you have to serve 6 months at your current rank+unit to qualify for a promotion in the system. I was 5 months into my unit when I got the downpes letter. My platoon mates all got promoted to LCP, while I got assigned to HQ and was reclassified vocation. Because of this, my 6 months timer got reset, and I was stuck at my PTE rank. This cost me about $150/month extra from the LCP pay I would have gotten (and subsequently CPL extra pay). Barely made CPL in time for my ORD. This is one way which enlistees get screwed by the rigid system due to something out of their control.\n\nThe claim process took almost 4 years for army to finally process, and they issued a service injury card and paid compensation.\n\nMy yearly medical appointments are covered by service injury card.

nlylpb,Older gen’s view of NS. Accurate? Incomplete?,"Felt inclined to make this post upon reading many ST facebook comments on Aware Chief’s call for review to “weed out toxic masculinity” in NS. Note: This post does not discuss whether females should be included in NS. It leans more towards discussing concerns about whether the older gen has an accurate and extensive view of what NS culture really is like.

In the ST fb post, there were many comments posted by older gen Singaporeans revolving around their admiration for NS’s capacity to nurture their sons into fine, decent men - the classic “ah boys to men” view. I acknowledge NS’s abundant potential for character development and I find this view completely valid since I have benefitted from NS. However, I wonder if older gen Singaporean’s views accurately accord to the reality of what NS culture is like, or are they instead incomplete and that they’ve arrived at these views either through their own account of what NS was like for them in the past, or through popular media portrayal of soldiers as sharp, upright and capable men.

My own parents were personally taken aback when I revealed the prevalence of swearing in NS. They certainly were not expecting enciks their age shouting “f—- your mother’s cb” every other day back in BMT. None of my peers and I were surprised by this upon enlisting, since we had expected this. Most of our parents on the other hand, were. Coming from parents that regarded NS highly, how taken aback they were by the reality of NS culture spoke to how incomplete their view of NS was (edit: lots of comments wonderin if my parents served - read edit 3. And also, i wouldnt say they were taken aback bcos they weren’t aware of the swearing. They prolly were aware of it at the back of their minds, but subscribed too much to the “NS grooms s’porean sons into fine, decent gentlemen” view tht it took them some reminders to realize what NS culture truly was again.)

19bxmcm,Will I have trouble fitting in uni/work if I don’t serve NS?,"I was supposed to go in May 2023 but just before that my father passed on unexpectedly (no underlying conditions) from heart attack. 

I got diagnosed with PTSD and MDD (from watching him pass) and my psychiatrist from IMH deferred me with no definite date. I still have no confirmed date for enlistment and am graded pes D. I have insomnia and on antidepressants for a few months now. I’m worried that when I enlist, I will finish NS at a very late age and in turn finish uni really late. 

My dad was the sole breadwinner so now that he’s gone, my mom and I have started to face financial difficulties. All this is piling up on my stress. Not even sure if I have the privilege of going uni honestly.

So if I was given an option to be exempted, would I be ostracised or can’t fit in if I apply for uni/work? Since the guys will have completed ns before enrolling uni/working and I see many posts about guys talking about ns as a common topic which I will not have any experience.

z9e3ns,To everyone who does not need to serve NS…if you were give the opportunity would you?,"Typing this in mobile, sorry in advance if the format is a bit off! 

This question is directed to everyone who is not legally male, since that is the type of folks that always get conscripted into National Service.

I had this discussion with a friend of mine (who’s a trans guy but still legally female) and he said he will be more than happy to serve if given half the chance (and by serve he means going through the PES A type of training that is “siong” so…yeah) So as a current NSF, I’m quite curious to hear from others who are not required to serve mandatory NS, would you do it? And for those of you who did sign on, what were the motivations behind it?

Over the past year or so on this sub there’s been an increase in the number of people asking for advice/help regarding mental health issues. 

Practically, it’s not possible for those experienced in these matters to reply to every single comment from each daily thread. Hence, I’ve decided to make this thread to consolidate some of the common answers to those seeking advice regarding getting help for mental health in this country.

My post will be geared towards seeking help from public institutions, as I’m not familiar with how things work in the private ones.

I’ll try my best to be as objective as possible in this post, but as someone who’s been dealing with issues of his own lately, I’m compelled to share some of my personal experiences and observations as well.

# In case of an emergency:

If you’re suffering from suicidal ideation or are otherwise in distress, and need someone to speak to, you can call the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS)’s 24-hour hotline at **1800-221-4444** or email them at pat@sos.org.sg. 

If you or someone you know are at danger to yourself or others, **call 995** immediately or **walk-in to any A&E Department** at any hospital. 

*****************

Suicidal feelings are temporary in nature, however permanent they might feel presently. The important thing is to keep yourself safe by any means necessary during this period of crisis. If that means you need to be hospitalized, then you should be willing to do so for your own safety and well-being. 

If you are deemed to be at physical danger to others or to yourself by the relevant authorities and professionals, you may be detained at IMH for up to 72 hours, or longer, under the Mental Health Act. This happened to me after my first suicide attempt. Yes, it sucks, but it's not as scary as it sounds.

g60rs4,"A GrabFood rider's perspective on how Grab overwhelmed LiHo with orders yesterday, but became uncontactable throughout the rush","Source: fb dot com /elfyhaikal/posts/10218951606734447

> This encapsulates how i felt like at Ground Zero today due the Bubble Tea Shops temporarily halting businesses during this Circuit Breaker period. As a Grabfood Rider, 8.45pm i received order to collect bubble tea from Blk 461 Yishun Ave 6, at that time, i was actually pretty far away near to Khatib MRT, was actually surprised ""wah! so far away get order there"", as soon as got closer, i noticed a whole stretch of vehicles and bicycles and PMDs and PABs. So there i was at Ground Zero.
> 
> Firstly, It was the Liho Staff, They were overwhelmed with non-stop orders and no way to stop it from coming in. There were only 2 staffs working in that outlet and over 400 cups of orders + about 100 grabriders waiting there.. IF there ever was a time when keep social distance failed, it was there and then. (100+ riders confined to a pretty small space)
> 
> Secondly, GRAB itself (cannot speak for Deliveroo, but i heard Panda also has this same issue), they were uncontactable, the Liho staffs were trying to call in to GRAB hotline (majority of the riders there were grab riders) to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn't get through to grab.
> 
> Thirdly, The Riders themselves looking for Rice Bowls (i am pretty sure the Waterway fight also is along this stance) our system is pretty bad actually, say, we have an order we couldn't complete, if we were to cancel it on our end, grab will not compensate us if we were to report it basically ""You cancelled, not our pasal"" However, if we were to call into grab and ask them to cancel on our behalf, we will be compensated for our time and effort, but, being uncontactable, most of us really have no choice but to cancel, some of us waited almost 2 hours for our orders and customers mostly refuse to cancel (mine was basically :teary eyed: please don't cancel, i don't mind waiting) but to no avail cause that outlet was beginning to run out of time and ingredients so ","[""Actually imo lah, Grab has to bear the responsibility.

aklzjj,Questions about wildlife in Singapore; Part 12: Red Junglefowl and other gamebirds,"Hi r/singapore , my focus this week will be on the Red Junglefowl and its relatives (collectively known as gamebirds) of Singapore.

The [Red Junglefowl](https://singaporebirds.com/species/red-junglefowl/) used to be found mostly on Pulau Ubin, and in recent years has started to become quite widespread across mainland Singapore. It lives mostly in forested and wooded areas, but has also adapted to many of our parks and other urban green spaces. Some of the places where Red Junglefowl (or birds that look a lot like them - I'll explain in a bit) are easily encountered include Pulau Ubin, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Bukit Batok Nature Park, Fort Canning Park, Pasir Ris Park, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, and Windsor Nature Park. There's a population in the Sin Ming area that was featured in an episode of [Wild City](https://video.toggle.sg/en/series/wild-city/ep2/328761).

This species is the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken, which is believed to have originated from [multiple domestication events](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/10ae/4cd4fb7cfd86dc0e40a991caa63980421e21.pdf) thousands of years ago in various parts of Southeast Asia, southern China, and the northern Indian subcontinent. Both the wild and domestic birds are all considered to be a single species, *Gallus gallus*. So how do you tell the wild Red Junglefowl apart from a [free-ranging domestic chicken](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lonesomecrow/16436354210/)?

The first is in coloration - domestic chickens come in all sorts of colours, while Red Junglefowl have a specific look - roosters have bright red skin on the comb (the fleshy skin on the top of the head), face, and wattles (the 2 bits of fleshy skin hanging beneath the bill). They also have a prominent white patch of skin at the ears. The plumage on the neck is golden-yellow, the shoulders are maroon or dark red, and the tail feathers are long and dark green. [Here's an example](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fryap/14191822787/) of a rooster from Pu",[]

123e2uf,Encounter with a possibly racist woman on the train berating a family over their luggage taking up space (more info in description),"
It's 12-ish, and I'm on the train. A family is sitting nearby with their bags and luggage. Anyone else on the train could see that they put their things as close to them as possible, trying their best not to take up space. Lady walks in, without any provocation, and shouts at the family, saying that they make it impossible to sit down in the seat next to the father, because of his luggage. The father moves his luggage out of the way best he can, but she still shouts at them, calling the situation (or them) ""outrageous"".

At the next stop, a new passenger boards the train and she sits next to the father - in the ""impossible to sit down"" seat. The voice recording was after this.

As in the picture, the woman had her umbrella on the seat. At the next stop, an elderly man boarded and wanted to sit in the seat next to her. She had to move her bag and umbrella away for him to sit.

I was preparing to leave at the next stop, the family was going to get off at the same stop. I stood up and told the woman - ""Look, your umbrella was on the other seat and the other passenger didn't have to shout at you to get you to make space. Why did you have to shout at them? Have some compassion."" She shouted back at me something like ""Speak for yourself!"" or something along those lines. Still mega confused about that.

Talked to the family when we got off and found out that they are tourists and they've already been having a really tough time finding their way since leaving the airport. To add to that they had to deal with this. Up to this point, they have never expressed anger or replied rudely or even raised their voice.

Am in contact with them, and told them that if they need any more help or if they want to make a report, to just drop me a text.

Still pretty appalled at what happened. I'm hoping they won't have to deal with more people with shitty attitudes while they're here.","['The child would likely be bewildered and traumatized.

164s2q7,MLM tearing my family apart,"
Hi guys, I really just need an avenue to rant because I really don’t know where to turn to. 

About 2 years ago my sister decided to join a certain MLM company that sells “Health” products. My initial reaction was “Hmm sounds  sketchy but whatever you do you and I’ll do me”. She claims it’s not MLM and she’s helping people “Live healthier lives” and be “financially independent” 

Over these two years I’ve seen this MLM shit really take over her life. Her social media posts are filled with ads about their products and recruiting others to join. She even gave up her job and has gotten so many of my cousins, aunts and uncles to join as well. I literally cannot escape, every family gathering they will talk about it, every social media post on my feed will be about them promoting their products.

When it all first started she asked me to come join her and I declined, however recently she’s becoming more and more pushy to the point where she told me that if I didn’t sign up she’ll cut ties with me because it shows that I’m not supportive of her. 

We had an argument recently when I told her that her entire MLM company is more like a cult, with her “If you’re not with me you’re against me” I just find the whole organisation and it’s members to be really cringe. They recently organised a huge gala dinner to celebrate their members “achievements” which to me just looks and sounds like the company pandering to their member’s desire for gratification and recognition. A psychological ploy so members feel they’re important so they will go out and recruit more people, sell more products and eventually make more money for the people sitting way up high in the pyramid. 

What would do you if you were in my shoes? I’m tired of arguing with her trying to get her to see my point of view. I’ve blocked all of my relatives who are a part of this MLM crap and now I feel alone. Am I the asshole for blocking out relatives who are so pushy just because I don’t want to be part of their MLM n","['Had a good friend who joined MLM that want to cut the friendship after i rejected her request to buy or join the club.

t8dtj9,Tracetogether revisited,"Wanted to give some thoughts after reading this article: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451)

Unpacking some of the points in this article:

\- "" Measures for contact tracing, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, will continue until Singapore authorities "" - 1) Is contact tracing still done and possible?. At the number of cases today its is highly unlikely that contact tracing is possible or even relevant. 2) many people do not report their ART positive status officially undermining contact tracing to be even possible; lets say for discussion sake that only half the people reports their Covid status, that means we have about 40k cases per day. Let say that each of them had contact with 20 people during their contagious phase. This would imply 800k people per day would be subject to ""contract tracing"" or about 14% of the population per day!; and 3) As per the same government rules one just need to sit it out at home when testing positive and can come out after 7 days in any case. **The rules literally imply no contact tracing to be required,** unless you wish to get you result registered, which is likely driven by the asymmetric advantages that you get for travel or to avoid a future booster.: ""If you are ART positive: 🏠 Recover from home. ➡️ No need to see a GP/polyclinic, if well/have mild symptoms. ➡️ To register your results with MOH, visit a test centre ""

\-  ""We need to wait until we no longer need vaccine-differentiated measures"" - 1) what about MRTs, buses, they are not vaccine-differentiated, people just hop on and off. And keeping 1 meter distance in MRTs of buses is impossible. - so lets agree that the country is not really in a in a complete vaccine-differentiated state; 2) how many people are really non-vaccinated, there are around 2-4% of 60+ people non","['Trace Together **WAS** useful. But now since we are shifting to endemic..its no longer that useful.\n\nFor now, its likely more used for gahmen to trace you together with who / where / what/ when/ how you go out to jalan jalan.', ""1) Contact tracing is irrelevant. The sheer caseload of covid cases makes ringfencing pointless. The virus is in the community, likely permanent.\n\n2) There was a very nice article that spoke about the ethics of vaccine-differentiated measures. Yes you want to encourage people to get vaccinated so you make life difficult for unvaccinated people. But there's suppose to be a limit to that. At the rate it's at, this is basically discrimination. Creating an artificial dual class system of vaccinated and unvaccinated people isn't a great idea. Enforcing it is unethical. \n\n3) Govts are addicted to data. Not just here in SG but all over the place. Tracetogether generates a considerable amount of data (it remains questionable how useful this data is since there's questions about data quality and there're so many other data sources). That is REAL tempting for governments, especially paternalistic ones. This is the reason why you want independent oversight. Anyone and everyone knew this would happen. And it happen. Trace Forever is here.\n\n4) I doubt the finances involving SDAs, safe distancing measures and automated gates are that big, relative to other expenses. But it's not the number that matters. It's the thought behind those numbers that worries me. There are those within our government and bureaucracy that think it's perfectly find to continue spending these monies on these redundant measures when we are in the midst of historic inflationary pressures, food and energy insecurity and a flagging/stagnating economy. Not to mention the pre-existing and new social issues we're facing today (there are a lot I no need to list down). We're spending on things that don't matter while barely doing anything for the things that really do matter right now."", 'Well, we need to revisit the words that Minister Vivian has said about collection of Trace Together data.

The data collected on people entering and exiting malls, stores, and other premises though is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see how people move thru a city/move between groups which the gov probably sees as extremely useful for planning and crime at the cost of inconveniencing us and taking away our last vestiges of privacy.

Perhaps they are starting to see the pros of having data tracked and the 'intelligence' or surveillance they gather might just be useful to them in many ways, e.g. tracking human traffic to different venues, interaction patterns amongst ppl. Now they are refusing to 'let go' of this vast amount of information."", ""All I can say is TraceTogether in its current state is them just mixing last night's cai png with today's nasi briyani, add in a 5 days old bowl of ice kacang, and a plate of Arnold's fried chicken from a month ago. \n\nThen proceed to shove it down everyone's throat, hoping we will all rate it food-king good(or not, as if they care).

A lot of the insane, pervasive, micromanaging restrictions along with all the backpedalling on lifting makes sense when you remember a sizeable portion of singaporeans (I\'d guess at around 33%) are huge hypochondriacs.\n\nI have colleagues who tell me in no uncertain terms that things like enforced social distancing with red tapes, having SDAs, pasting and announcing covid-19 reminders in every building, and needing people to scan in at gantries gives them peace of mind since they ""need not be scared of the virus this way"".\n\nThere is, obviously, a lot to unpack in their claims (tbh it\'s straight up fucking irrational as shit).

The minister said this knowing that there are people who will purposely hide the fact that they visited high risk places.

Yes some might argue that some of these people work in high risk environments and have no way of being able to take off from work and potentially risk not being able to put food on the table. 
This post is actually targeted at the people who have no excuses. Those that potentially contracted the disease when they engage in activities that break regulations set by the government. Such as frequenting these bars with hostesses or gathering in large groups and drinking.
These are the people who blatantly flout rules and then put others in danger by not coming forward to take a covid test resulting in potential clusters forming.

Do these people not have conscience? If they dont care about infecting other people in Singapore, do they not care about the health of their loved ones?

Should these people that break rules and then get infected with covid not be punished? Should they not be punished for infecting others and putting the health of others at risk? Should they not have to face consequences for directly causing and contributing to the delay","['im going to be frank here, lots of people break the rules its just majority dont get caught. \n\nI dont see the difference between these guys and the recent incidents of mediacorp stars meeting in a large group and those couples who met during CB. All depends on whether government wants to take action against them. \n\nATM, government wants these people to come out and get tested and isolated. IF we immediately state that they would be prosecuted, it reduces the likelihood of people coming out to get tested which is a lose lose situation.\n\nPeople are going to find these places whether the public likes it or not. I feel the solution is to attack the establishments that run these rather than attack the public.', 'The ones that should be sent to jail is the KTV operators who obviously flouted all the social distancing rules. \n\nOpen as an F&B business, BLUFF WHO SIA.', 'These are my thoughts:\n\nWhile yes, they possibly did do something wrong here, it is more important to protect the rest of the public from more infections that could kill more people. We can think about punishments after we trace and contain the cluster.\n\nAs to whether or not they should be punished, I personally feel that the punishment they could get from the workplace and home is sufficient. Like others have said, if you did managed to get Covid19, how are you going to hide that? In addition, by stating that they could be legally punished, infected people could hide instead of coming forth and get treatment.']"
fy86sc,So I went out to take away food and found a lot of elderly people blatantly disregarding the stay home advisory.,"Disclaimer: I live in one of the ""older"" neighbourhoods where quite a number of the population living here are of retirement age.

So I went to my hawker centre to take away food and saw quite a number of elderly people just sitting at the hawker centre tables. There were multiple enforcers around and they tried to advise very, very politely to the elderly folks that were just chilling and people-watching a totally empty hawker centre?? 

Despite the enforcer approaching them multiple times, they brushed off the warning and just shifted to another location where the enforcers weren't at and carried on their daily business.

There were also a few elderly folks that were just loitering around *without a mask*, just enjoying the empty scenery of the interchange/hawker centre etc. A few more just sat inside the interchange bench and people-watched. 2 more were just sitting by the charging port of the interchange and watching videos on their phones.

A few things to note here: 

1. the enforcers looked like they were in their 20s-30s and had to very politely talk to the elderly. I feel that they could have been a little more stern towards them and push them to go home. Being a 24 years old myself, I couldn't possibly do what even the enforcers have failed to do so. 

2. What could be the mindset of the elderly folks that despite many, many, many warnings from both the government and actual officials enforcing the rules, they still refuse to follow? They are the population that is most at risk during this situation, but yet they are the most stubborn ones that do not follow the rules.

3. I saw *maybe* 1 other person that was my age group, and he walked briskly around, probably trying to finish his things asap. On the other hand, there were at least 15-20 elderly people just loitering around.

What could we possibly do to educate/help the elderly generation?

ad4jtj,Elderly on MRT trains. Why some of them refuse to sit down.,"I did not realise how much of a challenge balancing on a moving MRT was for the elderly until I saw two incidents.

**Incident 1: Elderly man couldn't get up from his seat without help**

An elderly man was hesitant about taking a seat in the middle of the cabin even though someone offered an empty seat to him. He did so with some persuasion. 10 minutes later, I realised why he was hesitant. When the train was reaching his stop, he tried to stand up from his seat in the middle of the cabin. He was unable to get up from the seat by himself with no pole to hold onto. He was waving his arms and trying to stop himself from falling as he got up from the seat on just his two legs. The other commuters had to hold him as he was in danger of falling down.

**Incident 2: Elderly man didn't dare to walk to an empty seat**

Another elderly man was standing in the MRT cabin, surrounded by at least three empty priority seats. I was wondering why he chose to stand, when an auntie started to prod him to sit down in one of the empty priority seats. It turned out that he was afraid of let go of the pole he was holding on to. There was a young man leaning against the partition who was just slightly blocking his path to the empty seat. Just letting go of the pole and navigating that little detour on a moving train was a huge challenge to the elderly man.

**We don't understand the problems of the elderly because we have never been in their position and we look at things from our lenses instead.**

Even I do that. I have a 70-year-old mother. I was out shopping with my Mom. I was right behind my Mom. My Mom had turned her head away for a second and there was a little girl (maybe eight-years-old) who walked into our view from our left. She was going to collide with my Mom in one second. I saw the little girl nearing Mom, and in that split second, I remembered what I was thinking. I was like, ah, Mum will be okie.

14p69u4,help! How to not become an Incel,"M24 recently caught myself thinking like an Incel and i’m scared i might be turning into one. My incel mindset has been more frequent that i’d like to admit. How do i make this stop and develop a healthy outlook and mindset on dating and relationships?

Some things i struggle with is loneliness, resentment against my exes and desperation for a partner to the point i’ve even considered saving up to pay people to date me even just for a day.

some dating background: I’ve had 4 exes from secondary school to army (currently in uni). My most recent ex got together with her current bf a month after we broke up and i’m still here single as a pringle 3 years later. Still very salty about it. Kept asking myself is it because he’s taller than me or funnier than me or more charming than me. Tried dating apps for since then but only lead to fatigue and ghosting to the point where i’m feeling really hopeless and desperate. Matched with many girls who say they are looking for a rs only to later say they they aren’t sure if they are ready for a rs… i get so pissed about wasting my time and effort investing into these girls (age range i culture out for 18-25). why use dating apps if you’re not planning to meet people?

my hobbies include sports (i represent SG for overseas competition so i definitely have a toned ass body but for some reason girls aren’t really interested in men with nice bodies or sportsmen), stargazing, cooking (i cook only occasionally, but i love trying out different dishes and tastes), cycling and coffee, i’m also academically driven so i enjoy having deep conversations about any topic. 

Came from super conservative family who doesn’t talk about dating or rs too. These topics are like taboo at home so i feel shameful whenever i’m dating someone or my parents found out that i’m dating. My dad used to interfere in my sec school relationship by messaging the girl with my phone and asking her to cut ties from me and i will receive a good beating after having my p","['i think the types of girls you described are within a certain demographic/background/lifestyle who tend to exhibit this kind of behaviour. maybe you can go for a different category of girls?', '[deleted]', ""I think to break it down a little bit more:\n\n1. You feel lonely and resentful towards your previous exes.\n\n2. You desparately want a partner.\n\n3. Recent attempts to find a new partner has been less than successful.\n\n4. You have since taken on certain beliefs about dating culture and women in general - for example, what women are attracted to. This has been partially motivated by the social media that you consume.\n\n5. (This is unstated, so maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong) You feel resentful towards women for not recognising your value as a partner, and instead pursueing 'degenerate' men instead. This can be considered the culmination of the previous 4 statements.\n\nYou have also concluded that many of these beliefs, as well as the circumstances you currently find yourself in, is likely the product of your previouse life experiences. Your worry now is that the mindset and beliefs that you seem to be entrenching yourself in will result in you being single forever. \n\nYou're quite right that these beliefs are problematic, and I think the risk of these beliefs go much further than sabotaging your dating life. It also, I think, fundamentally affects the way that you see yourself, your friends, and the relationships you have with the women in your life - be they platonic or otherwise. Not to mention the fact that I think many of those beliefs are morally problematic and indefencible to begin with.\n \nI guess where I would start is to look at those 5 statements I wrote above and to really interrogate them on **why you feel that way**, and whether or not those beliefs are actually reasonable or not. \n\nFor instance, take statement 2: you desparately want a partner. I would start by asking, why you want a partner. You might say, to feel less lonely. But then you might continue to ask, aren't there other ways to feel less lonely? Is getting a partner the only healthy way to do it? What is it about a romantic relationship that differentiates it from other platonic relationshi"", 'Do you have female friends in real life?

Every relationship I’ve seen in real life, both people work and both people contribute to the relationship and the family unit they eventually build. \n\nSome guys want a stay at home wife and mother or someone who will accept their lead in the relationship and their lives and they then choose women who will accept that and don’t expect these women to turn around and have jobs to pay for everything. \n\n*Dating Criteria.* \nThere are also a LOT of single girls and women out there who may not be Barbie dolls but are still good people.

When you befriend a woman, don’t look at her as a woman before anything else, get to know her like you would another guy.

hnieiy,"On Friday, we go to the polls.","In recent weeks, a few things have weighed heavily on my mind. The 2017 reserved presidency, POFMA, and the calling of elections in the midst of a pandemic.

On the reserved presidency, it scares me that the Constitution - sacrosanct rules for any country - is something that can seemingly be ridden roughshod over. Widely perceived as a move to preserve power, artificial rules and requirements were suddenly put in place for presidential election candidates. Only one individual was therefore eligible. 

On POFMA, it scares me that the truth is what a small group of people can legitimately dictate it to be. To me, we have facts, which largely determine truths, which in turn determine what the falsehoods are. Facts are mostly set in stone. Did Mr A say “X”? Yes, that’s a fact. By saying “X”, is it true that Mr A is implying “Y”, which can objectively and reasonably be inferred from him saying “X”? Maybe, and in some situations both Yes and No can be correct answers. Sometimes, room for interpretation is necessary for what constitutes a truth, and what constitutes a falsehood. In the past weeks we have seen POFMA triggered in relation to politics. It is now clear that what is true or false under POFMA is only subject to one side’s interpretation as it deems fit. 

On calling elections now, it scares me that the PAP can be so opportunistic and power hungry at the expense of the people. The PAP has tirelessly trumpeted the need for a strong mandate so that a PAP government can properly navigate this pandemic. PM Lee says “COVID-19 is the crisis of a generation. It is more complex and more dangerous than any previous crisis.” Yet, despite the term of Parliament ending only in April 2021, and instead of focusing fully on dealing with COVID-19, Parliament was dissolved last month on the advice of our reserved president. 

Which is why we go to the polls on Friday. Which is why I am voting for change.","['[deleted]', 'Vote against bullies.\n\nVote against unfair practices.\n\nSet a good example to your kids and the future generation!', ""VOTE FOR THE WORKER'S PARTY!!

178xv96,[SSDC] [Class 3A] Passed my driving test today!,"Passed my driving test today! First timer with 14 demerit points. SSDC student. Total of 27 lessons taken (24 practical lessons, and 3 revisions). The posts on this subreddit really helped, so I figured that I should share my experience.

Background:-

1. I have an existing BTT since early 2000s. Signed up for BBDC back in the late 2000s, but did not complete my driving lessons. Took more than a decade to restart my lessons.
2. Decided to learn driving again after some encouragement from my now ex-colleague (thanks Mel). Started in late July/early August 2022.

Sign up process:-

1. Googled for private driving instructors in Singapore. Paid a downpayment to the contact person. Contact person then introduced a private instructor to me. Asked the private instructor some questions, and they were not helpful. Decided to take the loss and sign up as a SSDC school student.
2. No walk in allowed, at least back in late July/early August 2022. Gotta make an appointment online before proceeding to sign up as a student.
3. Sign up process pretty fuss free.

FTT:-

1. Passed during my first try. Think I got 49/50. I downloaded an app on Play Store that serves as a test bank. Did multiple trial tests on the app until I can consistently pass the test, with at least 48  points and above.

Booking practical lessons:-

1. When I started on my learning journey, I booked lessons online, and also used the SSDC bot. Progress was extremely slow due to a big gap between my lessons (for example, my first lesson was on 5th September 2022, and my second lesson was on 12 October). The gap is also partly my fault, given that I have urgent meetings to attend and had to cancel last-minute. Tried to camp for slots, but given that I'm working, it's really hard to snipe try-sells. Had 14 lessons from September 2022 to July 2022.
2. The SSDC bot doesn't seem to work anymore, so I suggest that folks shouldn't use it.
3. Decided to speed up the process by being the biggest irritant to SSDC. I made alm",[]
lkb2lm,Comprehensive guide to learning driving in Singapore + CDC tips & experiences,"Hi everyone, since I fairly recently got my Class 3A license, I just wanted to share my experiences and some tips that I have. I started learning in August, right after Circuit Breaker, and got in license in around 2.5 months, in October. If you haven't already read the [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9tzih4/guide_on_getting_a_driving_license_in_singapore/) by /u/SteamedChickenRice, you should do that first. It's a good step-by-step introduction to getting your license. I'll just be adding on some questions that I had, and some tips to learning at CDC.

**Step 0 - Pre-driving decisions**

There are usually a few things you'll need to decide on before you even start any lessons.

&nbsp;

**a. Time** - This matters to those with a short time frame, like learning a few months before university. I will say that learning can take anywhere from 1.5 months to over a year. It really depends on how fast you want to rush things, and how fast you can pick things up.

If you go for lessons every week, a rough [estimate](https://www.cdc.com.sg/course/class-33a) will be 24 practical lessons for Class 3A (auto) and 29 lessons for Class 3 (manual). Divide that by the number of times you are willing to learn each week and you can get a feeling of how long it will take. Usually, private learners are faster due to the fact they can go for the test whenever they want whereas a school will usually make you go through a fixed curriculum. I managed to rush it with 2-3 lessons every week, and taking only 17 practical lessons. Thus, I took only 2.5 months (I could have taken only 2 months if I had planned properly).

Another thing to consider is when you can actually start. The first thing you will need to do for either private or school is to take the Basic Theory Test (BTT). Go to any of the schools' websites to see their earliest date for BTT. Only CDC will allow you to take a few practical lessons within the circuit even before you have passed your BTT. You wil","['Nice comprehensive guide. Just to share one additional tip for someone who passed less than 2 years ago: anxiety is really a thing.

xddn61,"SSDC: Driving School & TP Test Tips, August 2022","Passed my first TP driving test two weeks ago after onneeee heck of a 3-month journey. \*wipes tears. :\_) Been a good speed-run, albeit with many frustrations pertaining to bookings, having to rush down to SSDC at last minute, having to put aside a weeknight hobby — all of which feels mega. worth. it. now. While I was still learning under SSDC, I scoured for tips on how to book for lessons (with… minimal frustrations…), on what to expect for practical lessons & the TP test, *basically* on how to have a less painful driving school experience especially with a system so backward.

Was v inspired by u/jazy_jaz who wrote this long, meaty, very informative guide ([https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/kc7x2n/december\_2020\_guide\_to\_getting\_a\_driving\_license/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/kc7x2n/december_2020_guide_to_getting_a_driving_license/)), so I also promised to the higher powers in the world that I will too give back to society and write a August 2022 version. But I really cannot remember the whole enrolment all the way til BTT process (took it a few years ago, & the process would most probs be different too.), so please refer to that post. 😅 Will instead share some tips/ hacks I’ve picked up from along the way, and info from customer service staff & instructors.

Just a note that these are tips *from pure personal experience* and ***are not officially endorsed***, but has helped me shorten the process. (Of course, I chiong-ed my way through & took about 3-4 lessons a week on my part. Having a fixed instructor also helped in expediting my progress & maximising the productivity of my lessons.) This is also written as the pandemic regulations are starting to alleviate, so fingers crossed that there won’t be much changes and that the system would increasingly improve, although do get used to an unpredictable & customer-unfriendly service.

rm7c9u,The hidden KPIs of the coronavirus pandemic,"It's tempting to measure the success of pandemic policies and measures based on the prominent KPIs such as covid cases, ICU occupancy, and vaccination rate. These are important metrics, but they are not the only ones that are important.

With this post, I want to start a discussion around some of the ""hidden"" factors that are not getting as much attention as they deserve. 

**Benefits & Side-effects of Vaccines Based on Age and Health Status**

People from the same age group are very diverse. A young female with pre-existing conditions and a healthy, active young male have very different risk profiles for both the covid and the vaccine. We know that obese young adults with pre-existing conditions are at higher risk of covid, and young males have a much higher risk of myocarditis from the vaccine, compared to the rest of the population. 

We should consider these variabilities of risks before deciding on blanket policies that treat people within an age group as homogeneous. By stratifying the population into smaller groups, Singapore could potentially maximise the benefits of vaccines while minimizing the side effects. For example, some of the Nordic countries have stopped using Spikevax for males below 30 due to myocarditis risk.

**Mental & Physical Health**

How are people coping? While I'm sure the safety measures helped many Singaporeans to feel safer, restrictions and overall uncertainty of the situation definitely have negative unintended and secondary side effects that are hard to quantify.

* An unstable economy is usually correlated with depression
* Work/study from home could lead to an increase in domestic abuse, poorer diet, and less physical activity
* Mobility restrictions and pressure to vaccinate could lead to anti-social behaviours

While there are attempts by the government to evaluate the mental health of the population, are they comprehensive enough and are they factored into the government's decisions for more restrictions?

**Effectiveness of S","[""For the vaccine part, I think it should be made mandatory for those above 60 to take it as they are a lot more vulnerable than those younger.\n\nThe mental and physical part is what I have been thinking about. I understand that the economy important, and our livelihoods depend on it, but Singaporeans' well-being is as important if not more. \n\nEarlier in the year, we had the vaccines. The government encouraged us to take the vaccine. Above 80% of us did. And only then, the restrictions became harsher. It went back to 2 people despite most of us taking the vaccine. Then just recently, the government announced that WFH is no longer the default arrangement due to the reason that 'face-to-face interaction is important for team dynamics'. And yet they do not even allow social gatherings at workplaces. \n\nDon't you just get frustrated by this. We followed what the government says. And in return, we got this. Maybe, in the eyes of the government, money is more important than the well-being of Singaporeans.\n\nI'm sorry if this seemed like a rant, I'm just expressing my opinion on the government policies during this pandemic."", 'On the last point, I understand that during the peak of the wave when we had 3k cases each day and our healthcare system was coming under significant strain, the government didn’t want to risk any further worsening so they kept all the safety measures around, even those that were quite stupid and/or most likely barely made a difference (e.g. music in restaurants). There was no appetite to experiment then. However, now that cases are relatively low (Omicron aside), I hope some serious evaluation can finally happen on some of the safety measures that may no longer be very effective but when revoked make life so much better and bearable. We now have the breathing room to try out lifting some measures and seeing if there is a spike; if there is none (like how cases continued decreasing despite 5 pax), then they don’t have much of an effect on the situation, and we can kiss them goodbye.\n\nFor example, outdoor masking (or at least in places like parks) would be one of them - there has to be a reason why so many countries are eager to lift mask mandates when they can (and indoor, not even outdoor), even including bastions of Covid-zero such as China and Australia. The face mask has become such a constant representation of the pandemic in Singapore, I can’t wait to be able to walk outside without a mask on again and feel the wind on my (lower) face.\n\nI would’ve also included restricted mall entry/mandatory check-ins as one of the aforementioned measures to be considered, but since the government seems to be going the way of more and more vaccination-differentiation measures and entertaining thoughts of revoking vaccination status for those who don’t take the booster, there’s zero chance it’s going away for at least the next half a year.', ""Wow, I really enjoyed the points you made on the effectiveness of our current safety measures. \n\nThe whole issue with safe entry gantries is definitely something to be sorted out asap if the government is planning to take a long-term approach. The shift to the use of automated gantries does not work at all during peak periods. I've seen multiple instances where the new gantries are completely disregarded and malls end up hiring temp staffs again to do the vaccination status screening at entrances.\n\nLikewise I don't think its an effective long-term solution to just hire these part-time workers to scan through droves of people on a daily basis, complacency quickly sets in. Especially considering the ease of faking your safe entry pass or vaccination status with a prepared screenshot for the unvaccinated to sneak their way in if they do desire to do so.\n\nI think we need to decide on how we are going to draw the line between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated in the future. The initial perks of entry and larger group sizes were essential back when the government was still promoting the public to get vaccinated. Now, however, with our current impasse of having a majority vaccinated population and a small group that is dead-set on not getting vaccinated, is it still wise to draw such a solid line between the 2 groups? I'd wager that people planning on going out in groups of 5s are already vaccinated anyways. And those who are stubborn about vaccination will undoubtedly find a way to exploit the situation if they desire to do so. \n\nWhat if we are to allow the public to have an honour system with regards to the safe-entry check in?\n\nThe way I see it, we aren't using safe-entry to conduct super-specific contact tracing anymore with our government's new approach and it being impossible to do so with the large number of cases allowed now.\n\nI don't see malls actively limiting people from entering nowadays and most malls are packed most days anyways.\n\nIf we were to just scrape ""]"
qps2vp,What you should know before flying a drone in Singapore,"https://www.caas.gov.sg/public-passengers/unmanned-aircraft

This is obviously referring to the NTU housing manager who flew a drone to check if the rooftop is cleaned. Judging by the replies, there's a lot of misunderstanding on why and how he really fucked up.

I owned a couple of drones and worked with people in the industry and authorities before, so here's my 2 cents and breakdown of the important stuff one should know from CAAS website. 

**TL,DR**: He broke all the rules that every drone flyer should know. Our drone laws are extremely strict due to past incidents. We don't want another case of PMD being banned


**1. Where can I fly?**

Flywhere.sg. or OneMap. Before you fly, just look it up on the site/app. You can also see that many areas are marked out, you cant be flying near govt buildings, sometimes temporary areas are created such as during National Day Parade. The drone app the pilot uses also has warnings and area marked out inside, but this risk being out of date because it depends on the pilot to update it regularly. You could also apply illegal patches to remove these from your drone app, but thats another story.

The NTU dude was basically flying within the aerodome of Tengah . which is like the first rule of no fly zone: stay away from airport and airbases

**2. How are drones being managed?**

https://www.caas.gov.sg/images/default-source/default-album/infographic-_regulatory-requirements-(1).jpg

There are 3 tiers of being a pilot: Recreational , Commercial and Education.

Recreational rules are the strictest, because you don't know who's going to be flying around and you are limited to so few places in SG that I've basically given up on the hobby.

Commercial purposes or using it as your job is what the NTU house manager should have done, it exists to allow legitimate and innovative uses of drones, but that unfortunately meant he broke even more regulations.

euvdoy,Travel bans and kneejerk policymaking,"Recently, I have noticed a lot of people politicising the decisions being made by the government with regards to travel restrictions (or lack there-of). I think there are a few things we should keep in mind before rushing to blame the government.

* MPs are not infectious disease experts. Realistically, they should not be making decisions based on their own gut feeling or on people's chatter. Instead of prescribing solutions, we should be trying to make sure that they are taking into account advice from experts in epidemiology, such as those in MOH who are probably (hopefully) advising the government on the response.
* Travel bans do not reduce the eventual number that will be infected; at best, they would simply slow down the amount of time taken to get there. [Health experts do not consider it to be a wise policy.](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/23/21078325/wuhan-china-coronavirus-travel-ban) Unless you have a leak-proof travel ban, for a virus with a R0 of \~1.8-3 (current estimates iirc), it'll still spread life wildfire as soon as a single infectious individual is imported. Singapore is not even self-sufficient in the short-term, so that is not a helpful strategy. It is much more important to have policies that reduce the [effective reproduction number](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mathematical-models~mathematical-models-models.htm~mathematical-models-2.2.htm). If the R0 is 3, to prevent the disease from sustaining itself in the local population we would need to prevent more than 2/3rds of transmissions. If this is done successfully, the disease would not spread very far locally; if it isn't, as soon as one infected individual gets through the travel ban we're fucked anyway. Even if you have a travel ban against all of China (not feasible due to dependence on imports), non-Chinese-citizens can likely still get through by taking a series of roundabout transfers. Let's be real, if Singapore residents who consider Singapore t","[""This thing is just letting all sorts of the latent anti-immigration and xenophobic  sentiment bubble to the surface.

t9989t,A Mostly Comprehensive Guide of Travelling from SG to Korea under VTL,"I recently came back to SG from Korea - under the VTL - on a holiday trip. While planning, we realized there was little information online on what the actual travelling experience would be like.

I thought it would be useful to provide a guide, giving some insight for those who are planning a trip or trying to decide if Korea is worth visiting at the moment.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is **not a definitive guide**. As guidelines and regulations **may have changed** since the time of this post, you should definitely do your own research. This post is mainly to give you a glimpse into the experience and quell major worries.

***Background:*** *We travelled to Korea from 15/02/22 to 01/03/22. We spent the first part of the trip in Jeju Island, then spend the rest of the trip in Seoul.*

First, a useful link regarding VTL: [https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m\_2435/view.do?seq=761362](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/sg-en/brd/m_2435/view.do?seq=761362)

***Pre-Departure:***

For Pre-Departure, there were a number of documents that we needed to prepare in order to be able to fly under the VTL. For our trip, it was the following:

1. Insurance Policy Documents (COVID-19 related coverage)
2. K-ETA Proof of Approval
3. Proof of Vaccination Certificate (Notarise)
4. Pre-Departure PCR Test Result

Let's go through each one.

1. Just print out the documents related to the insurance that you purchased. If you are unsure, try to call your insurance agency to clarify.
2. K-ETA is your visa for entering the country (introduced after COVID-19, boo...). The application costs about $12SGD per person. You will have to submit a scanned photo of your passport, and a passport photo, which both have a file size limit. I recommend using the Microsoft Lens app, it'll allow you to change the quality of your photo so that it can fit the size requirement. The application will also ask for a telephone number. You can either enter the phone number of your accommodation, your own Korean phone number (",['Just reading on the restrictions deters me from travelling to Korea lol.

135ev43,12 years relationship ending. Here’s a cry for help. Feeling lost,"Thank you in advance for reading. My partner and I (both 27) ended our relationship after 12 years. He called it off 4 months before our wedding. The main reason was because he felt we have differences in values and he cannot accept it. He is not the best in communicating and always bottles up things which was why when he finally effectively communicate to me, it’s always when he couldn’t take it anymore. We don’t have the most perfect relationship, but we watched each other grow. We were together since 15, and he was there with me when my parent passed away when I was 17. He was a huge part of my life like I was in his. 

Now that it ended, I didn’t beg for him to stay but it sure hurts a lot and I feel traumatised that it we were an almost and could have been. Our lives intertwines a lot and I still see him. I have to talk to him still about how we are going to call off the wedding as we already made payment and I have alot to answer to my family and friends who already knew. 

I have no siblings and I live alone as my parent is staying with my grandparents to care for them. While I still stay at my parent’s house. 

Please tell me what to do because I am malfunctioning and I really need to get through this period. I would really be grateful if you could offer some advice or even exchange some words as I really need someone and yet I can’t keep texting my friends as they have a life too. I have lost my constant, someone I regard as my family member and now I am all alone. And I do not want to be going on dating apps as that would be the worst idea right now. FYI, I will be seeing a therapist for this trauma. 

P/S: We attend the same gym, we have already signed for one year membership at that location. And we have a huge group of common friends. 
I also have my own group of friends and we are knitted. But it’s not possible to see them every week as they may be busy.

Thank you for reading","[""Sorry to hear about your experience. Never easy going through a breakup, especially after such a long relationship.  \n\nThat said, it's better for this to happen now rather than after you're married, or worse, after you've had kids. It sounds like he has communication issues, and this would happen sooner than later. \n\nRight now, I think the priority would just be to put some distance between yourself and him. It's impossible to move on while you're still talking and interacting with your ex. Try to settle the wedding issues ASAP, then cut off communication with him. \n\nTherapy is a good choice. Breakups are hard (especially one of this magnitude) but it gets better over time. Eventually, you'll wake up and not even think about it/him anymore."", 'its normal to feel attached, but time helps man.', ""Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this now. Maybe I can share just how much I can relate to this. 3 months ago, my partner of 6 years broke it off with me, I felt completely blindsided, my future and plans with them went up in smoke. I haven't had a good night's sleep since 5 months ago, when my partner first brought up the problem that they had fallen out of love with me.  \n\n\nFirstly, I would advise you to work on self-love. Recognise your own self-worth. Speak to your friends. Your true friends will always be there for you. Don't feel bad for needing to approach your friends. I personally went and cried my eyes out to a few close friends for the first month or so. A true friend will not abandon you at this time when you truly need a pillar of emotional support, even if it is just their presence. My experience is that no one will ever be able to understand you, because each relationship is unique, and it is your own.   \n\n\nSecondly, take your time to grieve. Don't give yourself any time restraint e.g. I need to be able to function as per normal in 1 month, 3 months, 1 year... the only way to get through loss is to grieve and feel all the pain. Don't suppress it, let yourself feel it, because to love is allow yourself to be vulnerable to feel the pain of heartbreak. But always remember, that what is meant for you, will never leave you. I would advice you to not think that you have lost 'the one' for you. Because I personally believe the love of your life would never leave you.   \n\n\nWhat worked the best for me, is to keep living, day by day. Be patient with yourself. Set daily goals, work through them. Even if you can't start by something small! Like a 5 min walk just to get yourself out of the house. Healing will come to you over time, I assure you that you will definitely be okay!! It is alright to not be feeling okay now.

Great that you are seeing a therapist. Honestly I'd invite you out for day drinking if this wasn't an anonymous platform (I'm 26F and going thru something similar).

I too went through something similar when my ex and I called it off after 8 years. \n\nHowever, I am now happily married to the love of my life.

Since it's a really long time, have you guys considered going for couples therapy to see if there is a way to meet in the middle regarding differences in values? It's okay to call the wedding off first, but considering the relationship is almost half your life and probably the amount of time you put into it, I do think there is some value in talking it out properly rather than through a bottled up release.

18ncn51,Is This Style of Workplace Communication Normal in Singapore?,"I have a coworker whom I'll refer to as M. Our interactions are quite...interesting: Whenever I speak to M, there's rarely any exchange of pleasantries first. I'm not talking about extensive small talk; instead I'm talking about an absence of even the most basic greetings like 'hello' or 'good morning'. This happens even if it's our first conversation of the day. M would simply walk over to my desk, suddenly appear behind me or next to me, and start saying something like, ""I spoke to A about B, and he thinks..."" This happens even after longer breaks, like when I come back from a two-week vacation. M would just suddenly appear beside me and go ""In the file you sent me, under tab X, I was thinking..."" There's no 'Hey, welcome back' or anything like that.

Personally, I don't mind this approach.  However, back where I come from, this would be considered an unusual style of office communication. What's more interesting is that M is a dedicated employee and seems perfectly normal otherwise.

1aoyz1z,Salary Ranges on MyCareersFuture And Lowballing,"Does anybody know the salary ranges for job postings on MCF work? Are they supposed to be base salaries only or inclusive of CPF and bonuses?

I recently interviewed for a role and am now at an advanced enough stage that HR has started discussion around compensation. HR claimed that they cannot offer me a further raise as the current figure is already top of the band. E.g MCF salary range says 10-20k, but HR says 8k is the max they can offer.

I am also pretty sure it's not a matter of job levelling or insufficient experience as I exceed the minimum years of experience in their job description. 

I actually applied for this role selectively after checking the salary range on MCF to ensure there's a chance they can meet my asking. It would have been a huge waste of my time if that figure is just not true.

Are employers allowed to post anything they like when it comes to the salary range (i.e false advertising) or is this just a lowball attempt by HR?


**Update:** 

Gave up on the offer. I tried negotiating with the HR in charge of this role, but they wouldn't budge. In fact, I realized that the offer figures she quoted includes bonuses and that the base offered was in fact slightly below my current base, which I have already communicated to them at an earlier stage.

Asked about the salary range on the MCF posting, she claimed that she ""cannot offer me at the level, hence cannot give me the salary range in that posting"". This is a tech MNC which title and levels are well determined and I have confirmed throughout the interview process so I call bullsh1t on that. 


P.S Figures are made up to avoid doxxing myself.","['I got a job offer recently. The role was listed on MCF with a range, so when HR asked I gave a number that was on the higher side of the range. \nThe HR then told me I can’t use that as a benchmark as they use that range to attract more talents. I told the HR too that isn’t that unethical as well since they are false advertising? HR was then speechless and said that they can’t offer the amount that I was asking', 'Base salary. Only applicable if you’re foreign talent, or if your previous base is equally high.\n\nSource: had a HR person tell me that directly to my face', 'If they’re advertising on MCF for Fair Consideration Framework purposes. Then advertised salary must be clear, specific and consistent. Max salary range cannot exceed two times the minimum salary. https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/consider-all-candidates-fairly \n\nIt’s probably a low ball attempt from HR to discourage you from applying further.', '[deleted]', 'Been in HR for years. MCF ads salary is based on the fixed monthly pay. As such, bonuses and variable payments should not be included in the range amount. Technically CPF is fixed so employees can include it but I would say it’s rare and I have personally never included it. \n\nFor foreigners, during the EP application stage, the salary offered must be within the band. Eg: band is 10-20k, cannot offer 8k. For locals I think no hard and fast rule since there’s no need to submit the EP form so it’s based on what both parties agree.\n\nYou can always raise up a compliant to TAFEP if you feel discriminated by the ad.\n\nEdited: add more context', ""Hope you got a screenshot to back you up.

My company will advertise a role on their own job portal, and after finding a suitable candidate they'll put the post up on MCF and 'interview' locals to satisfy MOM requirements, but their mind would be made up on the candidate they want before they even speak to any locals. A waste of everyone's time IMO. I'm also surprised they even bothered to use salary as an excuse for rejection - an experienced HR person would just say 'not suitable due to cultural fit'."", 'Red flag. Screw that company', 'It’s monthly base. It will not even consider commission part of OTE for sales folks. And if they apply EP/SP the monthly base cannot be lower than advertised \n\nThis means that they are willing to pay a foreigner more than a local. I will report the job ad. They got not much teeth but their work pass application may be scrutinised more. \n\nKind of an asshole behaviour by them\n\nIf you are local, mostly likely they are trying to keep cost to company the same.

e1b4pa,Just wanted to get it off my chest,"I feel so overwhelmed. Today, I finished my A Level exams. The paper was 3 hours long and unreasonably hard, but I went home hoping to hear a word of congratulations and affirmation from family. It really sucks because that giddiness of relief and happiness from finishing this journey of my teenage years just shattered two minutes into stepping into my home because of a mother figure who is so riddled in insecurity that she treats every single thing uttered as if the other party had plotted with evil intentions to insult and ridicule her, and projects her insecurity of being insulted onto others by being consistently toxic, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy. The paternal figure is confrontational with absolutely no ability to hold a conversation without roaring three sentences in, nor does he use any form of communication skills to, actually, communicate. No amount of reasoning helps when they simply don't listen. And I'm just typing away here going deaf from music at the highest volume so I can drown out the jabs they keep taking at each other. After so many years of this it never really gets easier to tolerate but today of all days it just feels so utterly depressing

Edit: I posted this 4 hours ago not thinking that this would even get remotely 5 replies so thank you to everyone for the genuine kindness shown to me. What made me feel down today wasn't so much the fact that they didn't throw a big fuss or reward me for completing my As (because I don't expect that LOL it's just exams) but rather the lack of warmth between family members, and its absence was especially glaring today, because I think I might have appreciated it. Thank you to everyone that offered a listening ear, and those that congratulated me and reassured me that moving forward, things will get better.

It has affected me even today (almost 50), and after lots of therapy, I have managed with the reality of the situation.\n\nMy advice is avoid escalating the confrontation.

7vpfrj,What is Singapore's Schelling point?,"Thomas Schelling did a survey of people in New York City, posing the following question: ""Tomorrow you have to meet a stranger in NYC. Where and when do you meet them?"" You have no way of communicating with them beforehand.

Interestingly, most of the people chose the same time and location -- 12:00 noon at the information booth at Grand Central Station. So, if you told two people in New York that they had to meet a stranger tomorrow, but didn't tell them where or when, there is a surprisingly good chance that they'd actually find each other.

This kind of landmark, a choice on which many people could agree without communicating with each other, came to be known as a Focal Point, or Schelling Point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)

I made it a point to try to talk to her and I thought that it went pretty well. Asked for her IG on Saturday and Tele on Sunday. We texted sporadically and one day when I asked if she'd be free for a meal in Jan, she voiced her concerns that:
1. We've got a pretty huge age gap, and,
2. She's emotionally unavailable. 
She thanked me for being intentional and active in pursuing her (and girls in general), and I haven't replied her since Tues night.

I know that for ladies, age gap is a huge and valid concern, for sure, but I never once thought of it as anything major. Eventually, I imagine we'd all be working our jobs and living that staple Singaporean worklife. 

How do I try to communicate that I still want to try to pursue her without invading her space and respecting her boundaries? My intended course of action is to check up on her once every 3-4 weeks, share some stupid videos, or some nonsense, and make small talk—all to communicate slowly that I still want to be your friend and eventually break that ice (not in an ambitious or invasive manner).

I'm Christian, yes. But any helpful practical advice is still a much needed advice!

193765e,EZ-Link Card and SimplyGo (and how transition could have been done better.),"Ok with this new move by our Transport authorities, I can try to explain how the Old CEPAS Cards compare to current SimplyGo Cards, and how it could have been done better.

Old CEPAS EZ-Link cards are storage-based cards, basically think of it like your SD Card/USB Stick. Cause the money is stored in the card itself, the card shows its balance when boarding busses/trains/slotted into IU for cars. Issues with the system is say for example you lost the adult card, you basically lost money in it unless you remember the 16 digit CAN ID on the back of said card (since it’s anonymous), or you linked it to the EZ-Link app back in the day. This is different from Concession cards (the ones with ur IC, name and Face on it), since the authorities have more info to track said card and return the money back.

New SimplyGo cards are account-based cards, like your Google Drive account. The money is stored on servers with SimplyGo. I believe the data transmission to the card from servers is to strive between allowing you to board public transport and what relevant info to tell you on card reader hence you cannot see the balance (take my words with salt, I’m basing it on experience with TL Staff and observations). Also, you have to not only maintain a balance of minimum $3 (or else you can’t use the card for 2 days lol), top-ups recommends 10 minutes to update the servers (probably thought of as a small issue since you probably have to wait for a bus but still). One thing about SimplyGo is that if you lost said card and block it, you can transfer the money to your new card. But no inserting to IU, no card balance reading.

Honestly felt that the authorities should have done a different way.

1. Announce suspension of adult CEPAS card issuance and begin sales of only SimplyGo Cards. (They are doing the 2nd part run)
2. Honour remaining CEPAS cards to their Expiry
3. Improve the SimplyGo app, quite buggy still.
4. Innovate to allow card balance to be readable at the card reader.

If w","[""It wasn't just the lack of planning and foresight that pissed off commuters.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a Singapore bus enthusiast, one of (probably) around 500-700 people who have taken interest in our country's public transit system. There is much praise and criticism amidst the current issues that our public transport system is facing; we do have our fair share of complaints as well. Nevertheless, the public transport system is something that us enthusiasts greatly appreciate, despite how it may look like ""just another boring aspect of our lives."" We document interesting happenings in the public transport system - particular models of buses appearing on service said model does not usually appear, first/last day of service of particular bus models, new service launches, interesting advertisements etc. Some of us are also into bus technicals and operations such as engine workings, driver scheduling etc. 

Our hobby is also quite controversial amongst netizens - ever since some incidents of immature and selfish bus enthusiasts conducting themselves inappropriately in the public surfaced, our actions have been subject to much scrutiny, both within and out of the hobby. Some people have labelled us as people ""with nothing better to do"", weird obsessed people that are a threat to society etc etc.... But on the other hand there are those who understand what we are doing and respect us for documenting something that is a daily part of so many peoples' lives, yet so underappreciated.

Ask me absolutely anything. I will try my best to answer!

1724a18,Guide: How to make sense of NEA 24h PSI/1h PM2.5 vs AQI PM2.5 readings,"There has been considerable confusion regarding the different values, but u/lesarbreschantent's comments have been helpful in explaining the differences. Thanks <3

# NEA [24h PSI](https://www.haze.gov.sg/) readings (Updated hourly)

[Screenshot of the 24h PSI tab on haze.gov.sg](https://preview.redd.it/sf2yol2caxsb1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fda36967fc384925615bf15099496da34ad953)

The NEA's Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) reading provides an overview of air quality that is averaged over a period of 24 hours. It takes into account the **concentration of** **6** **pollutants** \- particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). If you want to understand how the value is computed read [this](https://www.haze.gov.sg/docs/default-source/faq/computation-of-the-pollutant-standards-index-(psi).pdf).

**How useful is the 24h PSI in informing your daily activities? (Opinion)**

Not very useful as it averages over 24 hours. Since the PM10 and PM2.5 values that make up most of the haze can vary wildly, the current haze situation can be extremely different from the 24h PSI.

# NEA [1h PM2.5](https://www.haze.gov.sg/) readings (Updated hourly)

[Screenshot of the 1h PM2.5 tab on haze.gov.sg](https://preview.redd.it/4iopv3kaaxsb1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=660c40440c618b4b6af1281d748625fefbd31309)

PM2.5 stands for fine particulate matter on the order of 2.5 micrometers or less. These tiny particles make up the bulk of the 'hazy' fog you see during the haze season. Due to their small size, they can penetrate into the gas exchange regions of our lungs and cause mild reactions or even damage.

NEA has air quality monitoring systems across the island that measure PM2.5 levels in real time. However, the data is averaged over a period of an hour and updated on their website.

4wkknv,A comprehensive guide on how to excel in SCDF as recruit (PTP + BRT phase),"First up, congratulations to all future cadets that will be serving your NS in SCDF. I will tell you that you are some lucky b**t**ds! 

Secondly, I just want to clear the air for those ignorant parents out there. The current and recent intake do not only recruit ""ITE and certless"" guys OR Malays OR PRs.  There are plenty of Singapore born and raised Chinese diploma holders serving SCDF as of the latest intake. 

Be prepared to face well mannered people inside. (There is one exception and I will explain below) 

There are 4 companies (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta) 

Alpha & Charlie (Less Fit intake - PTP, serving full 2 years) 

Bravo (Fit Squad - BRT, serving 1 year 10 months) 

Delta (Fat Squad - PTP, Serving full 2 years)

No personal attacks on Delta company but it's very obvious when you see delta, you know it is them. 

Not sure if your certificates determine your company, but from what I observe, Bravo has 95% diploma holders, Charlie 80% of diploma holders. Each company has around 120 cadets. 

Next up, I will start from the routine and regimentation. 

For Alpha, Charlie, you need to wake up at 5.45. Bravo wakes up at 5.15. I have no idea what time Delta guys wake up. 

You will wake up to do a short 5-10mins water parade, then move on to gather as a company level for morning 5bx. 5BX exercises are purely for warming up and waking you up for the day. If you go to the gym or do regular exercises on your daily routine, 5bx is nothing - Easy af. Unless that particular Company CDI (Instructor) decides to make you guys to exercise more, then too bad. Every morning there should be one appointed Sir + CDI. 

Greet them every fucking time, don't forget your manners. This is something many recruits tend to not do because they feel embarrassed or not used to it. If you want to do well in SCDF, be smart about all the small details. The CDI / Sirs will teach you how to greet. 

Another important thing to note, always remember at the back of your head - This is NS, you ",[]
bh7v99,Thoughts on NUS Town Hall,"I attended the Town Hall hosted by NUS.

**Good lord** it was a shitshow. The three panelists, especially Prof. Ling, were woefully underprepared, like as if they weren't ready for some of our questions. Half of the shit they said was ""Leave it to the Review Committee"" or ""I'm sorry"". And then, they had to leave at 6.30 on the fucking dot, without extension. Like as if we weren't important. The moment the last girls had her point to say, about them needing more town halls and proper methods to **make sure** what we said gets put into action, all Prof ling said was , and I quote, ""Thank you for your feedback"".

I'll add more thoughts when I've got time, but I'm fkn pissed rn.

EDIT: Okay, this somehow double-posted, sorry mods. I've got more stuff to say


-- We really felt like as if our comments may fall under deaf ears. Harsh, yes, but given the dismissive nature of most answers, it feels like our comments would just be taken into consideration by the review committee without *any action*. We **need to know** if what we say is really considered and not just to appease our need to voice out.

-- They had almost no plan in place, apart from something about victim support. It really felt like this town hall was to ask us for solutions, as if they couldnt come up with a plan on their own. The victim support plan was good, but most answers about student safety, increased discipline, educating about these issues (especially the latter), almost begged us to provide them with answers

-- Prof Ling, dear God. For a Vice Provost of Student Life, she knows jackshit about us students and our lives. She had no clue what doxxing was, asked us for suggestions cause she couldn't think up of one, or hasnt come up with a plan yet, and was more out of touch than a theatre major learning how to code. I bet she's a nice person, but in no way should she be in charge of student life. If we were our *'children'* as she says, she's not being a good parent.

dcn4c5,//RANT STORY// Entitled auntie on MRT,"To start off the story, I live in the east part of SG and I travel to the north for work. The journey takes about 1.5hrs, so sometimes if I’m running late, I will just leave home first then do my makeup on the train ride instead cos I don’t want to screw up all the transfers timing. So that particular day, I was running late so I planned to do my makeup on the train ride. I boarded and after the train cleared a bit, there was finally one seat but it was the dreaded ‘reserved seat’. I mean honestly if I can choose, which self-respecting millennial would choose to sit there and suffer the constant panic attacks that someone is secretly filming them not giving up their seats to the elderly? But sadly that day, I was that self-disrespecting millennial which think ‘aiya just sit and faster get my things done’ as I don’t want to turn up for work looking like zombie from The Walking Dead. So I sat down, took out my makeup and was just about to start dabbing it on my face, when the train door slide open at the next station and my nemesis to be rushed in and started to look around the train for a seat anxiously. She looks late 50-ish, with a pixie-cut short hair dyed in reddish orangey colour, and was dragging along her wet-market exclusive canvas trolley bag which have spring onions poking out of it. 

My detailed observation of her was my downfall, as it compelled me to look at her face and that led to us having eye contact. It was that moment when she realised that I was the youngest amongst others sitting on the reserved seat (the train was not packed but there were no available seats and she have a good view of everyone sitting down. There were late 20s/ early 30s ppl sitting on other reserved seats too). Once she had the eye contact, she dashed right in front of me and said: “Can you give up your seat to me? (ni ke yi rang wei gei wo ma?)”

18ivgar,New wayfinding system being piloted in Yishun and the Central area,What do you think?,"[""I like that they used the same map style as the Locality Maps found in MRT stations - it gives consistency. It's also good that the map is oriented in the way the signpost is facing, reducing confusion.\n\nHowever, I find the use of 3D landmarks strange as the buildings seem random - i.e., Ocean Financial Centre & Capitagreen don't really have unique building shapes, so it's hard to use them as wayfinders. Even more strange is the absence of the Merlion nearby, which is definitely a location many tourists will be looking for.\n\nBut what I'm more concerned about is that these signposts might blend in too well with their surroundings (e.g., heritage/trail signposts, building directories, other existing signposts, etc.) such that it becomes hard to look for them. I would suggest making them more identifiable (like maybe a cube with a map symbol on top)."", 'Yishun, best town.

iop505,Lost my best friend to church (HOGC),"Bringing this topic from ask/Singapore and this was heavily discussed 2 years ago on this subreddit. I would like to hear the views of believers/ non- believers and your experiences. 

I lost my best friend of 15 years, he left quite a pretty stable well paying corporate job to join the church. I tried to encourage and support his passion but We drifted because of stark difference in ideals. And I just couldn’t simply accept even though I tried to show support by going the special events or testimonies. E.g. as below-

- tells me they shouldn’t walk or hang out one on one with the opposite gender, must consciously hang out with opposite gender only in group. We used to shop and hang tgt over chill drinks, but nope, said material things or giving to parents are secondary, need to give the money back to build church and god. 
- Constantly questioning me as if I sinned when I went for chill drinks at company townhall. Told me it’s wrong if I hung with an opposite gender one on one even if it’s platonic long time friends as may give wrong idea
- He felt like him liking a Christian girl from a different church in the past was him going against values (cause differnt church values).
- He felt proud of me when I gave some offerings, disappointed look all over his face on the days I didn’t give. 
- Questioned in contempt on why the Buddhist/ Taoist altar is still at my house when my late grandparents (they were believers) are no longer around. 
- Constantly Questions other religion Buddhism/ Taoism practices on 7th month prayers and the effect of burning to environment, the point of different altars and gods (I’m not a believer, just being exposed when I was young due to late grandparents. Understand the environmental effect but I can’t give an arguments to these without much understanding either.) 

That being said, I do not discredit the benefits/ solace they can bring or give individuals- he seems happy. I believe people there are generally nice and not ill intentioned. ","[""Doesn't seem very healthy to use the bible to make people self loath. \n\nIn fact in such circles, it's very common to see this cycle of self-loathing leading to self-righteous, holier than thou attitude turning to hypocrisy and judgemental hatred being projected to others. \n\nit's fucking scary tbh."", 'I pray to Yusof Ishak, no such problems here.', '> questioned in contempt on why the altar is still at your house\n\nSorry what the fk? I’m a Christian (not a good one) but i still think your friend is overstepping his boundaries. I once attended HOGC and was an active member there from 2014-2016 (when they were in the process of moving to a new facility to host their services) my 2.5yrs with HOGC was a depressing one. Initially, things were great, the people were nice and friendly and included me in many activities. i didn’t have a large social circle back then so being accepted by the people from HOGC felt nice and validated me. However after 6months, there was this constant pressure from the leaders. There was this unspoken but rather intensively implied need to bring our friends to HOGC regardless of their faith. Their messages strongly emphasise that the church values are always right and we have a spiritual duty to reach out to the people out there. Needless to say, this was a very toxic mindset and i lost a couple of friends outside church. I was upset about it but the friends in church always said things like its their loss and we know better than them, giving rise to this false impression that we are the “role models of Christ” thankfully, as i entered tertiary education, i began to meet new people and i came to realise the misguided mindset HOGC was preaching. Soon after, i made my decision to leave the church. I have nothing against Christianity, this is just from my 2.5yrs of experience with HOGC.

I informed the friend who had brought me to HOGC and... 2 people from the church showed up at my doorstep unannounced, and would not go away. They insisted on being let in.

19275mh,Should I go back and work for my ex-boss,"I worked under him for several years, had to leave for progression reasons. We still kept in touch and our spouses know each other. He recently got wind that I'm about to join another employer, and asked me out for coffee. Basically he joined another company at a fairly senior level, and asked if I was keen to join his department. Here are some pros and cons of this guy:

Cons:

* His offered pay is pretty mid relative to market, I'm to take a 30% pay cut working for him
* Somewhat boomer management style at work including:
   * Will humor your opinions, ultimately his idea is always the way forwards
   * Very slow progression, 5-9 years for 1 promotion
   * If there's increase budget to his department, he rather hire more headcount/vendor than increase your pay more than 5% a year.
* Calls you after work hours to chat about non-work stuff, happens occasionally maybe 5-8 times a year.

Pros:

* Family oriented, will actually ask why you are staying late. Ask you go home spend time with kids/spouse.
* If you do work late, he will recognise it one way or another. For example buying bf for you only next day.
* Has no problems assigning you non-critical projects with long time timeline if he feels it will help you grow professionally or build relationships with certain people.
* His taichi skills are phenomenal, will literally sweep aside labor intensive and low value trash projects at the HOD and C-level. Basically shit doesn't flow down past his level.
* Very low-stress working for him, every other department can have their hair on fire all year long, but you can OTOT go for 2hr lunches and start to knock off around 5pm.

smn0bb,Why do Singaporeans not insist on better bike infrastructure?,"I know... I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity & the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people.  Bear with me 1 sec.   Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun & healthy.  Climate, gradient & size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation.  If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you.  Rain just cools you more!  I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry & clean up.

Only problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful.  Regulations & design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right.  The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs & trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.

Today I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub.  First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail.  Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise).  There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why?? Second photo shows an inaccurate Google Maps which made me think I could easily cross Merdeka Bridge to get to Sports Hub - I encountered multiple staircases to cross the bridge, barrier walls preventing m","['[deleted]', ""There are cycling groups such as Love Cycling SG and even the Singapore Cycling Federation that have called for better cycling infrastructure and policy making during focus groups and panels hosted by the Government. \n\nUnfortunately, more often than not, the Government has not been very good at listening. For example, at one of the more recent ones involving the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, hosted by then-MP Yaacob Ibrahim (so glad he has retired and was never a minister, good riddance...) they ended up focusing more on making cyclists wear PPE, prohibited handlebars wider than 700mm on footpaths. They completely omitted usage patterns of cyclists, pedestrians, motorists and of course infrastructure. Basically they gave a set of advisories to the Government that puts the onus only on cyclists to manage their behaviors and equipment, without touching anything on policy and infrastructure. It was odd that they never listened to the cyclists that participated in the panel, and gave more weight to the cycling shop owners instead.\n\nBut oh well, it's not all bad. The most recent cycling related focus group did result in what I feel are sensible. Road cycling groups are now not allowed to form a length more than 5 bicycles long. I agree with this because I have seen ridiculous things pre-covid, i.e. length of more than 30 bicycles. That's like the length of 2, maybe 3 buses.

mb44b9,Friendly Neighbourhood Ang Moh needs some advice from r/Singapore,"Hey guys this may be a little long. Also, apologies if this is in the wrong place but I felt that it is too long story for a daily thread and the story adds some context to the questions I have. 

Story time....a year and a half ago before this COVID mess met and fell madly in love with a lovely Singaporean girl. I was working in your beautiful city  at the time and we have been inseparable ever since. Last September I got the phone call that everyone dreads. My father unexpectedly and suddenly passed away. 

I flew back to Scotland and generally had a miserable time until this little ray of Singaporean sunshine called to say she had booked flights to come and see me and check up on her guy....half the world away. This blew me away. 

What happened next turned our worlds upside down again....she fell pregnant. This was amazing news, although we didnt directly plan it, this little surprise bump has brought meaning and after the misery of 2020 things are looking up. 

Late Feb 2021, after a full month in quarantine (2 weeks in Dubai then 2 weeks in Singapore). We were back in the Garden City when once again more bad news hit us. The job I had been promised was no longer an option and with that it's going to be doubtful that I will be allowed to stay in Singapore with my love and my kid thats on the way (g/f is currently 21 weeks along). 

I had always planned to marry this girl but now it looks like I am going to have to hurry this plan up if I want to be here to support my girlfriend, baby and actually be here for the birth. 

So, my questions are:
1. Where can I get a ring that wont cost me an arm and a leg? (I am on a super low budget, havent had a wage since October)
2. Where would you recommend for a romantic proposal? Again I am absolutely out of money but i want to make this special for this wonderful human.

Good luck!\n2. For proposal venues, to be honest, I am also looking for advice on this lol. One place I'd suggest is the rooftop garden at Esplanade. It has a great view of the bay and it's free!

At that point, if you decide that you want a ring with a diamond in it (the posters below have made excellent points about the De Beers racket!), we got a pretty big discount on our engagement ring as it is 'imperfect' and glows blue under black light.  Which we thought was super cool.  But again, you may want to hold off.  My wife lost her wedding ring (not the one with the cool glowy diamond) a few years ago and then just went to have another one made - we've been together for a long, long time  and so we just roll with it.

As another has said, Botanic Garden is beautiful - and the orchid garden within is even nicer.  The waterfall at Jewel is pretty neat (and good dining right there) but likely to be more crowded.  If she likes the outdoors, Seletar Reservoir Park is dead quiet at almost any time of day so you have a pretty view of the reservoir and not a lot of public eyes (no nearby good food and getting there may make her suspicious if you are going for a surprise, but there is always lots of parking).  If she is an animal lover, the Zoo, River Safari, and Bird Park are all dead quiet during non-school holiday periods.  Unusual place to propose, but I know of at least one person who had their wedding at the Zoo.\n\nGood luck!"", ""Assuming that she didn't get with you for your money, \n\nTbh, any ring should do. Its basically a promise, and you can give her a fancy one later. A simple gold band from poh heng or gold heart should do. For now. \n\nRomance is about the time and feel. And a mini camera recording it all. Some places I can think of, the beach. Botanic Gardens, a couple of the art gallerys, and of course, on top of the ferries wheel where she can't run away.""]"
1b1yqf0,AITA for giving ang bao to dogs?,"okay so this is a bit silly but my cousin just won't let it go. 

Over chinese new year, we had a big gathering. During this gathering, some people brought their dogs. The dogs were all dressed up and looked super cute! Some even had little ang bao bags. So I gave ang bao for the dogs too. 

The problem is my cousin is nosy and questioned about how much I gave, and when he found out I gave the dogs the same amount of money I gave his kids (a generous amount), he blew up at me - saying how his kids ""deserve"" more, and how I'm putting the dogs on the same level as the kids. He's saying I committed a  faux pas in chinese culture and I need to make it up to him.

He's always had an issue with how well I treat my own dogs and how much money and time I spend on them, which I don't really see as a problem. He's always making little snipes about it.

Their metro system is arguably better than ours."", 'I found many people unable to accept why Hong Kong is number 1: \n\nLet me give my hot take given that I take both cities’ public transport regularly.\n\nBUSES:\n- HK’s bus companies are incredibly competitive, most bus services would have at least one or two variation. For eg. 86x 86k etc. they would intersect one another’s route but connect different estafes but through a shared common path. Another eg. 682, then 682A 682B. Those two others are only offered during peak hours and they do some additional stops to pick up people in less common estates. \n- Their buses are mostly point to point and very efficient. For a comparison, imagine a bus leaving orchard road area and the next stop goes straight to Bedok or Tampines area, our SG rep for this bus is bus 23. But in HK it’s almost every bus that plows Nathan Road (their main “orchard road”) \n\nMRT:\n- In this area, we are pretty close in terms of quality\n- However, our train interchanges design are not well thought of, you can imagine most of their lime transfers are just like our city hall / raffles city kind, just crossing the platform is a change of line. Usually to implement this you need to use two stops on a parallel line overlapping in two stops (which we lack space and density to perform this feat except the old two lines)\n- Their frequency at peak hours is sometimes less than a min, that’s how insanely efficient it is. \n\nTAXIS:\n- HK taxis are notoriously shit, however you have to give it to them for their old housing estate planners, their transport hub in each estate would contain: taxi stands, minibus stands, and bus stands. (Yes stands only not much seats found)\n- SG does them in malls but not everyone live near malls and despite our density our estates are quite sparsely spread that this model doesn’t work for us \n\nThe last piece of the puzzle:\nMINIBUSES\n- this is a natural occurring last-mile problem solver created by the free markets. It appeared due to public bus drivers going on strike and they appeared t', 'Train fault at NEL now...', 'How is HK 1 lol?? Public transport here sucks', ""Japanese rail network is very impressive for its size and extensive reach throughout Tokyo. Their consistency with being punctual must also be acknowledged. But I think it is rather fair that Tokyo itself is lower than Sg based on my personal experience, not that it means anything.\n\nWe sometimes see rush hour crowds at MRT stations making the news, but it's very common for them in Tokyo. The trains can arrive on time but the crowd will still be there because there's a limit to how many trains can hold. Too many lines sharing the same rail probably makes it difficult for them to throw in more trains to support the large population too. And while buses are punctual too, they come in low intervals. Travelling around Tokyo takes planning to be efficient. Travelling around Singapore is conveniently efficient (aside from train breakdowns, but even then buses are quite convenient). Quality > quantity alone is not enough. The Japanese are definitely doing very well in terms of quality though. Good service from staff too, they really love their mic and speaker announcements haha.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, their train stations and underground subway network is impressively large. But they're not the most accessible and friendly. Lots of stairs and not enough elevators and escalators. If we consider the elderly, the mobility-impaired personnel within our society, it can be difficult for them to traverse through the subways. I see some lift assists for wheelchairs but they're mainly in the metropolitan downtown part of Tokyo. Around the outskirts and further from the center you will see less of such support available. Take for example Shin-Nihombashi Station still within central Tokyo. There are escalators within the station itself, but not on any of the street access exits, and also no elevators available. There are also no wheelchair lift assists that I could see at the exits either. \n\nCouple other minor points to add.\n1) Transport costs. Public transport in Tokyo is much "", ""Surprised Shanghai is so low on the list, no way is it worse than KL's"", 'Hong Kong SAR is 1st?

sold an item to buyer

tomcbc,WUSG is being run by Terry Xu of The Online Citizen,"Full credit goes to the original Today article [here](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/wake-singapore-apologises-publishing-false-claims-against-kkh-says-it-was-lied-over-miscarriage-case-1855071) for drawing this to my attention.

**TL;DR**: Terry Xu, former operator of The Online Citizen is now running the Wake Up, Singapore website after the original founders all left. The Online Citizen was caught red handed manufacturing outrage for clicks. The recent behaviour of WUSG with the KKH controversy shows that he's still using the same playbook to turn outrage into advertiser dollars.

**Update**: Terry claims he only helped register the site and doesn't run it. After some additional sniffing, it seems like The Independent is running the ads on WUSG now. Receipts in the [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/tomcbc/-/i29yt5f)

After the recent KKH debacle, I was thinking that WUSG sure seemed to be following the same path of The Online Citizen (TOC.) Alternative news site which started off relatively moderate descends farther and farther into outrage and clickbait.

For the uninitiated, TOC was founded in 2006 by Remy Choo and Andrew Loh as an alternative news website, long before alternative media would even be a widely accepted term. Over time, the original founders would leave - and TOC began a slow slide into polarized takes that would cater ever more to the hardcore anti-papper. By 2016, TOC was a [one man show](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/the-online-citizen-goes-dark-ahead-of-deadline-set-by-imda) run by Terry Xu. The website has been trundling along ever since, with no shortage of controversies. Most recently in 2020 it came to light that TOC was [hiring Malaysian authors](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-bully-elderly-woman-the-online-citizen-video-shanmugam-1405561) writing under pseudonyms to paint the police in a bad light. TOC was eventually taken down in late 2021 after [failing to declare their source","['[deleted]', ""Wanted to award you on the previous post but seems like it got removed. Thanks for the work. \n\nThis also explains the change in direction of content in recent years to be catered towards rage clicks (also didn't help that Meta's algo was prioritising that to increase engagement/stickiness to their platform). \n\nDo you reckon there could be a possibility that the lady's story is completely fabricated given Terry's track record?"", ""Follow up inspired by /u/the_piper_maru 's comment about how WUSG's site has more ads than a porn site (lol) so once again\n\n**TL;DR** Terry might be telling the truth about not running the site. If anything, he might be used as a patsy. Actual owner of WUSG likely The Independent, another alternative news site in SG.\n\nI'd actually missed the ads on the website completely when I was digging around the first time because I had adblockers running. Now, the reason why WUSG would start a website is for the sweet sweet ad revenue. You can't randomly run ads on Instagram, but you can do that very easily on a website you own. Google makes that very easy with their AdSense product - you sign up for an account, get an ID and when people see and click your ads, you get paid. \n\nNow, following the money (as you should) you can rummage around in the source code of the WUSG website to find the [advertiser ID](https://imgur.com/1X3yOxC). Using this ID you can find other websites which use the same ID to identify common website owners. Plugging the pub-9336012417325337 ID into [this site](https://dnslytics.com/reverse-adsense), you get [three entries](https://imgur.com/rcJNC1j). I spent real world money on this nonsense just to see the historical record locked behind a paywall, by the way (you're welcome).\n\nThe Independent is a familiar (albeit surprising) name - using the .co domain instead of the .sg domain. Pageseven is a name without information, with the most activity coming from this [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pageseven_co) page that spends most of its time signal boosting The Independent.\n\nI thought the PageSeven thing seemed a bit weird. The site's dead now, but you can dig into it using [The WayBack Machine](https://imgur.com/MPrsvAy) to find a different advertiser ID used, pub-4631505357773597\n\nPunching that into the reverse lookup gives a whole list of [interesting names](https://imgur.com/AVKLAt3) - most of which are dead (special mention goes to sensuellknullmassage."", 'Nothing more than a moneyspinning company masquerading as woke.\n\nTerry Xu realised that woke/SJW is the way to get clicks these days. The Wakeup.sg website has more advertisements than a porn site', ""A lot of diehard WUSG readers seem to care more about hearing what they want to hear (SG is terrible, the establishment is bad etc) instead of nuance and truth. \n\nIt's not surprising that alternative media like WUSG/TOC usually end up resorting to using 'alternative facts' and outrage stories to satisfy such demand."", 'That botak and his full of shit shit-stirring antics', 'Lol the same guy who smeared our Police', ""His response below. I not agreeing or disagreeing with you or him. Just sharing what I see:\n\nThere is a number of posts going around alleging that I am running or part of the Wakeup.sg team. \n\nThose are fake news. \n\nI had earlier helped the Wakeup.sg team to register the domain in September last year after they have expressed interest in setting up a website. After their preparations are completed, I then transferred the domain over to the team in Dec last year. \n\nThis is why the contact person is not me at this point, though the registrant name is under my name. \n\nThe MSM that pointed this out, did not contact me for clarification and I suppose they are happy to let this misrepresentation stay for the astroturfers to do their work. \n\nI believe the team at Wakeup.sg did not mean to mislead the public with their reporting. From their documentation of what led to the false claim by the lady, it would be hard to solely put the blame on them as the lady had deliberately told a story to them, knowing that it was false. \n\nAs for those people making remarks about the Yishun Police incident, please note that the judge is due to make his judgement in time to come after a hearing in early March. \n\nThe application to appeal against the Minister's POFMA Correction Direction was made in June 2021, that is like close to nine months and the judgement has yet to come out. \n\nThis is way far from the 9 days of proceedings as claimed by the Minister of Law to assure Members of Parliaments about the legislation when POFMA was passed in Parliament."", '🤣 thanks for the CSI\n\nI am laughing at the young crowd that the thinks WUSG is trusted and credible']"
r1mlji,Tried to get a refund from Lazada 5 times over 4 months for a $400 phone but to no avail. What can I do?,"Ordered a $400 phone on lazada at the start of Aug but it never arrived. I have already contacted their customer service 5 times and each time they give me the same message

Update1: 
looks like im going to have to wait again (see screenshot). abit annoyed with all the waiting but ill give them 1 more try. had to make a big fuss on facebook messenger, send them this thread, threaten a police report + small claims to even get my first email from them saying that they will cancel the order. mind you there was no word on the refund yet but i guess ill wait (very impatiently).

pmkkc3,The case for the innocence of the Malaysian Police helicopter incident,"In my honest opinion, I think this unfortunate incident was just an honest mistake. More to be added to this list when I think of stuff. Comments and differing opinions are very, very much welcomed, but please be civil and remember- we're just having a discussion on Reddit, not waging a keyboard war. Full disclosure, I am Malaysian, but in this post, I try to use facts and logic to come to a sound conclusion. If the facts and logic point to an intentional breach of airspace, then I will come to that conclusion. I am NOT a pilot, but I do know a thing or two about aviation, both civilian and military. Any pilot opinions are more than welcomed

Factors supporting the innocence of this incident:

1. **Malaysian AW139 helis do not have RWRs and any intelligence equipment, and thus cannot tell if they are being tracked by a radar or collect substantial intelligence.** If you know anything about military aviation, you would know that not having an RWR when entering hostile territory is the dumbest thing to do. If you do such a dumb thing, you have essentially signed your own death warrant. If this craft was deliberately intruding into SG airspace to test SG's military readiness or to provoke a military response, this aircraft would be under-equipped for that mission- to say the least. On top of that, if it was on a supposed intelligence gathering mission, this heli would again, be severely underequipped. It did not have many sensors that a usual intel aircraft would have.
2. **This specific AW139 was carrying a VIP.** Don't think they'd intentionally go into hostile territory where they might be shot down by- well- every single air defense system SG has to offer(btw- very interesting SG still uses Igla MANPADS. I'm a big fan of Soviet SAMs)
3. **TLDR: Navigation errors happen, and have a higher chance of happening in VFR flight.** The long version: The route the heli takes is a common route. If you look at historical ADS-B data, you would be able to see that PDRM has flaw","['Oh I fully believe this might be an accident, but the timing is unfortunate.\n\nThis reminds me of back in 2015, a couple of guys wanted for drug related offenses wanted to avoid police and (unfortunately) ran their car through barricades at an high level security event - the Asian Security Summit at Shangri-La Hotel. \n\nAs they ignored police commands, and the police had every reason to believe they were hostile, the police opened fire to stop the vehicle and killed one of them. \n\nI’m just really thankful things didn’t escalate to that extent. If our side had open fire, things would have gone ugly.', 'Prolly was a mistake by the pilot. \n\nBut they apparently went to a base near Pedra Branca.

And it happened on the day and at the time that we were celebrating our national day no less - fashbacks to operation pukul habis. So pardon us if we saw this as a sign of threat from the new government (the timing is impeccable). Now, barely 3 weeks later, another incident happens in which our border has been enroached upon. Even if it’s an accident/mistake, we are already on our toes from the previous incident. What did you expect us to do?\n\nThird, if if was indeed a mistake that the pilot took a shortcut that meant he flew over the border, trying to dodge responsibility doesn’t help the case. Own up, say “we made a mistake, sorry” and we can both put the incident behind us and move on to other more important things. But by denying it by saying they flew “near the border” and “not been alerted about any breach”, it’s dragging the situation out longer than it needs to and turning it into something bigger than it should be. (Flight path images show the island was flown over, the police have just issued a statement that they did indeed fly over p. Tekong). This will be written into the history books, but how it will be written is still to be decided. Will it be something unworthy to read about or will it be part of the next cross-border dispute?', 'Eh, should this not be the MY foreign minister’s job to convey to his SG counterparts?', ""My question is that if the heli was warned to leave the area by ATC. If the pilot was warned, and he choose to go ahead and not change course, then it is skewed towards a deliberate action than a honest mistake\n\nScrambling air assets isn't cheap, and I would think our side have strong reason to believe that there was a potential threat before the F-16s took off\n\nAdding on yesterday was the anniversary of 9/11, 4 unarmed and totally innocent looking commercial jets wrack havoc in the US. There is reason to believe that even an unarmed helicopter can do certain damage if allowed into a high destiny country like ours\n\n I rather we believe in some theory, if we keep alert and ready, then believe it's some error, and continue to sleep. You never know when the next innocent looking aircraft might be the real malice"", 'Maybe you could\'ve mentioned that the VIP is part of the Malaysian military\'s national security and intelligence committee equivalent that just happened to accidentally fly into Singapore\'s military base.\n\nAnd you don\'t really need to know if you\'re tracked by radar to test the readiness. Another important aspect would be how long it would take for Singapore to scramble their fighter jets\n\nEdit: To provide some context, according to Malaysia\'s National Security Council\'s official Facebook page, the person in the helicopter appears to be the newly appointed Director-General of Malaysia\'s National Security Council. The helicopter was en route to Abu Bakar naval base.\n\nAnd I quote the DG\n> Terdahulu saya menerima taklimat daripada Kepten Shaiful Fadhli bin Ismail, Pegawai Memerintah KD Sultan Ismail berhubung kawasan keselamatan Op Benteng Laut Sektor 8 di bawah Kawasan Tanggungjawab (KTJ) pihak yang berkenaan sebelum menaiki penerbangan menggunakan helikopter PDRM ke ABMB di Batuan Tengah.\n\nWhich loosely translates to ""I (the newly appointed DG of Malaysia\'s Security Council) was being briefed by an officer with regards to the security of the area before boarding the helicopter"".\n\nIn addition, usually in most countries, when you\'re ferrying or escorting VVIPs and it\'s a planned event, the security details would usually plan ahead of time the best route very carefully. But of course there can be exceptions.', 'Let me just share a bit of my insights on this incidents...\n\n1) Intruding SG airspace on Sept 11 is probably the worst mistake you can ever do. Regardless of whether it\'s a mistake or not. Last time I check, if a pilot makes an error, lives are at stake. So I don\'t really buy it. And like what some people said, if he cannot even just following the border lines, properly, with or without equipment. He shouldn\'t be a pilot. SG could have literally use SAM and shoot the helicopter down, instead of sending F16s. Do you really wanna know why we didn\'t? Or it\'s just a pure ignorance? We sent F16s because our command didn\'t want to unnecessarily start a war. That\'s why we didn\'t. We always acted with restraint.\n\n\n2) Our past history with Malaysia has been nasty. Look when Msia decides to launch military exercise in 1991. Or when Msia threatens to cut off our water line if we didn\'t do your bidding. Or when Msia decides to park their vessels in Tuas? All these are an act of aggression. And like what you have pointed out. Past history does not mean that you guys have the intention to conduct acts of aggression. Really? You truly believe in it? I cannot change your views about it. But think of it as a perspective of us Singaporeans. Nobody likes aggression. We only acted appropriate to it.\n\n\n- When Msia threatened to cut water, if I didn\'t remember wrongly, LKY mentioned that he would consider it as an act of aggression, and would attack. Look at SAF slogan. \n\n- When Msia launched exercise in 1991. Close to 500k SG guys were activated during National Day as a precaution.\n\n- When Msia ships intruded our seas in Tuas, we sent out naval ships as a way to show force. You know that we could have easily destroy all these ships right?\n\n\nMany of times SG acted more appropriately than our so called ""Big brother"". Msia cannot even get a grip of themselves man.\n\n\n*Do you know why our Government and your government has way friendlier relationship when Najib was in charge? Go and do a lit', ""It's most definitely a mistake, but it speaks of basic blatant disrespect for singapore. Such a basic error should not be made by someone with a pilots license, particularly someone from a professional organisation such as the police. \n\nThis isnt the first time, or the last time, when malaysian vessels or aircraft have deliberately or mistakenly entered into singapore terriotory. Having a malaysian helicopter fly over a singapore military base is NO LAUGHING MATTER. There comes a point where you got to ask yourself, wtf is malaysia doing? \n\nBy contrast, sg makes a VERY SERIOUS effort to not intrude into malaysian airspace. The takeoff and landing of jets from tengah is extremely tight for pilots. We dont make excuses, or 'oops!' \n\nI'll give you an analogy. You have a neighbour with a dog who likes to shit everywhere. One day, he shits on your doorstep and makes a mess, and you complain. He apologises, tells you not to be so uptight. You let it pass. Mistakes happen, a dog is a dog. \n\nHowever, what happens when this happens not the second, but the third, fourth fifth time? Is your neighbour just being ignorant, or does he have ill intent out for you?"", 'Accident or not, it was still a potential threat that SG needed to deal with.

A Liechtenstein spokesman said, ""It\'s not like they invaded with attack helicopters. No problem, these things happen""\n\nThis is how malaysia does it:\n> Throughout the official assignment that has taken place until now, PDRM did not receive any notification from Singapore’s aviation authorities about any incident of a helicopter flight entering their airspace”', 'A radar warning receiver identifies targeting by a fire control radar. It is not practicable to install warning receiver that detects search radar, because detecting the low energy emission of a search radar will mean picking up a lot of radar clutter, nor would it be practical because almost every country in the world owns military search radar. A fire control radar, on the contrary, emits a high power, narrow radar beam at high energy to acquire sufficient information to hit a target, and is therefore practicable to detect via radar warning receiver.\n\nFire control radar lock is not routinely used because it is considered a deeply hostile act under international norms. It is an internationally accepted norm to warn off the intruder via radio contact before escalating to other measures, including fighter escort or ground-based instruction to land at a designated landing area.

p9pgnv,What small inconveniences (COVID-19-related or otherwise) are wearing you down?,"I'll go first.

I'm tired. I think we're all tired.

I think what's wearing me out the most is all the small things - death by a thousand (paper) cuts, if you like. Vaccination didn't bother me, masking up to go out is bearable, even seeing my friends and family less often and in smaller numbers is all right, especially since it keeps the more vulnerable safe.

But having to walk around and around to get into (or out of) a building because there's only one entry point? Many buildings have closed off entrances and exits, so instead of being accessible, they're more diffficult to get into. (I try not to think of what will happen if there needs to be an emergency evacuation.)

It’s a small thing, I know. A low-level annoyance, but one that I come across every day, often.

And there's a good reason. TraceTogether alone isn't enough, so we \*have\* to check in and out of everything so if there's a case we don't just track the people close by, we also trace those who entered the building.

Still sucks that all the easy access, and convenient routes that were planned when these pathways and buildings were built now no longer function.

There used to be an open-air walkway between JEM and Westgate on the second floor - convenient, right? Well, no, not any more, because it's closed. Instead of an easy connection between the two buildings and to the J-Walk that connects to NTFGH and the Devan Nair Institute and IMM, you have to go down, out, and up again.

Frankly, in some cases the single entrance point seems to be chosen to cause the most inconvenience and difficulty - the one furthest away from public transport, the one furthest away from the taxi stand.

I hope I'm not alone. Are there things like this that affect other people?

I know this is all part of the new normal, but I feel like we haven’t even recovered from the events of 2020, and then we encountered an even mo', 'Oily nose and face cause of constant mask-wearing :P', ""This isn't small - as a foreigner, not being able to go back to see family members in home country for the last 2 years.

x7c2ps,Do you envy any of your friends with rich parents / both with a silver spoon?,"Curious. Some claim that this group of people don’t know what is hard work and have not gone through any form of hardships since everything is given and laid out on a silver platter to them. Some say these group of people are pampered and everything they have is because of their parents efforts. They get to go on fully paid exchange overseas, buy designer bags monthly, a brand new BMW for their birthday present etc. One poly classmate of ours have her own chauffeur who will open car doors for her. Another colleague at my workplace casually told us he didn’t opt for BTO as he was gifted a 2.3mil fully paid condo as a wedding gift by his dad. Another friend’s parents fully paid her wedding at Andaz recently which amounted up to 55k. 

On the other hand there are ordinary folks like us, who have to save and budget our salary every month. We work our ass off only to have a take home salary of 3k and after factoring the bills and allowance, we’re down to 1k ish. We can’t casually say we wanna take a gap year to open a cafe or start my own passion project as that will mean 1 years worth of salary is gone to waste. Also, it’ll take us years to save up for housing and wedding, and some of our parents or siblings depend on us for their daily expense. This group however will somehow despise the those with richer parents, and understandably why. 

Personally I don’t envy them per se, but I envy the freedom that they have knowing they have that financial safety net. They are free to pursue their actual interest and if it fails, they have a strong backing to catch them. Two sides to the coin tho, I’ve also learned to persevere through adversities and have a stronger mentality towards challenges. Then again, I mean come on, if your dad tells you ,” Son, here’s your Merc GLA180 and the keys to your condo at Marina One” , I’m sure most of us will take it hahaha.

We were able to save up what we needed with my first month salary for that surgery. But it was too late, and he unexpectedly passed away just a few days before he was scheduled for his appointment.

8o5fgr,Do MPs and grassroots volunteers pay for parking?,"First, a news bulletin to clarify some of the information and misinformation swirling on social media about parking for civil servants, MPs and grassroots volunteers. Do civil servants pay for parking at work premises? In general, yes. If they didn't before, their ministry or the agency they work for is likely to change the rules so they do. 

That's one reason why the Ministry of Education decided to start charging teachers for parking in schools. Most other ministries charge staff for parking, and MOE should do likewise, the Auditor-General's Office said.The decision makes sense when you consider that Singapore maintains a ""clean wage"" system for public servants - a wage system with no or minimal hidden perks or benefits in kind. But the decision drew much public attention and flak - from people who felt that making teachers pay for parking somehow devalued their contributions to society. That debate continues to roil online, but the Government is holding fast to its stand that a clean wage policy means civil servants pay for parking at their workplaces. So that’s clear for civil servants. 

**PARKING FOR MPS**

Online, there was also much chatter and questions about MPs. Is it true that they get to park for free at Parliament House? Intrigued, I asked the Clerk of Parliament. Answer: Yes. MPs - elected MPs as well as Non-Constituency and Nominated
MPs - get to park at the restricted staff carpark at Parliament House, which is not open to the public, but only for staff and authorised visitors and persons. Staff pay $139.10 for a monthly season parldng ticket Like other civil servants, they pay for parking at their work premises. In contrast, MPs park for free. The rationale is this: ""Members of Parliament (MPs) do not have offices in Parliament House and do not require full-time parking here. As authorised persons to Parliament House on sitting days or when they are here for meetings to perform their official duties, MPs park their vehicles at the restricted carpa","['I’m just gonna say the arguments made to justify why MPs don’t pay for parking can be used to justify why teachers should not pay for parking.

========

There are way too many dudes who kena the feedback of ""You look too plain/boring/uniqlo/fugly"". I don't think it's fair to call our local dudes ugly or lazy; they're busy balancing the (unfair) societal expectation of being/becoming providers and the human need of having a life. So here's a step-by-step style guide.

This guide has 5 parts:

1. Your Colours
2. Choosing Fabrics
3. Cuttings
4. Coordinating Outfits
5. Wardrobe Curation & Shopping

## Part 1: Your Colours

Notice how Uniqlo's clothes look so good on the model, but so plain on commoners? Well, Uniqlo is mass market, so the clothes need to look decent on everyone, but not neces","['This post should be mandatory national education', 'Wah, you should start a blog on this sia. Maybe can earn some ad revenue and sponsorships for photo content as well. Very detailed and well-written.', 'Great guide. Something important that isn’t stressed enough here: be very cautious of stylized clothes. It’s easy to fall into the trap of buying a tee that has your favorite anime character or shorts that have cool ocean waves.\n\nThey’re fun, but they’re also very challenging to match. The more elaborate the stylization, the harder it is to match.\nMaster the basics of plain colors, then add touches of boldness.\n\nI deeply admire the genuinely cool people who can go full prints or manic colors effortlessly, but those folks are few and far between.', 'Singaporean/American here. Uniqlo is awesome. Don’t get me wrong here… \n\nJ. Crew made things stupid easy for me. I’m style-deficient, but nearly everything J crew goes with everything J Crew. It has made it so much easier to dress. \n\nThat aside, this is a fantastic post and thanks for your work here OP.', 'Tried shopping at other places, always find myself returning to Uniqlo because the cutting is perfect while other shops had inconsistent cutting. Uniqlo for life.', 'Can give tips for females. My wardrobe is black, grey, white or navy. Lol', ""I get a feeling most commenters think OP is male. **She's** not."", 'I cannot emphasize how singaporean men dont utilise tailors enough. Most of the time, for the same price or slightly more, you can tailor a shirt that fits you. A zara shirt for example costs you like what $50-80? For $60-70 u can get a shirt from a tailor. It doesnt have to be just work wear, you can often tailor something abit more casual as well\n\n\nAlso every dude should invest in one suit when they can, as it pretty much lasts you forever (until you gain/lose weight). You can get it tailored for ~$400 for top and bottom if you find the right tailors in singapore, or even cheaper (~$300) when you go to bkk. I know it may seem expensive compared to just getting a g2000 suit off the rack, but it is definitely worth it. Avoid fully black suits at all cost. Go for charcoal which is much nicer, or navy if you prefer that\n\n\n*edit google hardwarezone tailor and theres a fantastic thread since years ago (and still ongoing) with recommendations and reviews', ""Hello thanks for doing this guide.

They did a face swap and guess what...the ugly guy didn't look any better even though you've now put him in nice clothes. And conversely the good looking guy still looked good even though what he was wearing was frumpy. sigh...I do want to update my wardrobe but I feel so discouraged sometimes.

I see many people nowadays with the round specs and my specs are still square...not too sure if I can get on board with this trend"", 'Stellar post, thanks for the in depth course king.', 'All the fancy styling and Armani in the world does nothing if you’re a BBFA.\n\nMy advice is to get in shape first before even thinking about any fancy clothes', 'Take all my upvotes!', 'For me the most important thing is the cutting.

How classy is a restaurant if it\'s in a lousy shopping mall that also has a Maccas and a NTUC? There are just not many places in the country that are more than neighbourhood level, so that\'s the standard of clothes needed, just walking around the neighbourhood in the hot weather, just something with thin fabric will do.\n\nThis hot weather is perhaps the most important factor. All this fancy clothes are all made with a cooler climate in mind, it keeps all the heat inside, and in Singapore it slowly cooks us from the inside, and so a singlet or oversized T-shirt that gets some air in there is preferable.', 'Too long, back to Uniqlo', 'I\'m sorry you lost me at ""Beyond Uniqlo""\n\nSeriously though, I know your whole point isn\'t that people should get clothes from elsewhere.

ci2v6f,Truelove.is has proven that it's not interested in listening to critics,"Hi! I first posted on [r/singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore) about [my visit to Truelove.is](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bqbu8r/i_am_a_gay_exchristian_and_i_attended_a/), where I found that they are centred on a mindset that refuses to engage with criticism. Instead, they ridicule, discount and demean their critics. I have been following their recent Instagram ""fake news"" scuffle, and I noticed that [someone else has already posted about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ch80jx/instagram_account_trueloveissg_is_promoting/). I feel like it's timely for me to chime in by linking my own experience of the group to my thoughts on their current stand against criticism!

**TLDR**

1. They misuse POFMA language, because POFMA doesn't cover criticism, parody or satire
2. They refuse to engage sincerely with criticism because to do so entails considering the possibility that they are wrong
3. Yes, they advocate conversion therapy!

Before moving on to the article itself, I just want to appeal to you to share [my Medium post](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/truelove-is-has-proven-that-it-cannot-listen-beb16200d3c0) on your social media. Together, we can put a stop to homophobia in Singapore, regardless of how disguised it might be!

Previously, I wrote a piece titled[ “I am a gay ex-Christian and I attended a Truelove.is event”](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97?source=post_page---------------------------), in which I documented how this movement behaves behind closed doors. Amongst other things, I found that Truelove.is operates on an ideology that refuses to engage productively with criticism, choosing instead to interpret rebuttals as attacks on their identity and not their ideology. To recap,

>*Truelove.is’s wilful aversion of engaging with criticism is a return to an “out of sight, out of mind” strategy that discounts the critic as someone worth en","['They do take a leaf out of the pages of their US counterparts (the Christian Right specifically) in casting themselves as the victim, and imagining that they are somehow hated and persecuted for them being Christians. To be sure, there are Christians around the world who are actually being persecuted for their faith; it’s just not happening here or in the US. \n\nThis does bring to mind Bilahari’s recent remarks on the three threats facing Singapore’s social cohesion. Evangelical Christianity definitely ranks up there. The influence of the Christian Right on evangelical  Christianity here certainly reminds me of the kind of influence that the Saudis have in spreading their Salafist doctrines across the Muslim world. Both have access to immense political and economic resources to spread their ideologies.', 'i really cannot stand how some churches and chiristians just take whatever they want out from the bible and ignore the rest.\n\nmany of the times, their actions are exactly what the bible warned against (no, not one sentences like those about homosexuality being used to worship other gods, but like whole stories)\n\nbut like who cares because gAy bAd amirite?', 'this is so fucked up. im a christian but i would never in a thousand years come remotely close to believing the ignorant, cruel bullshit this supposed “support group” is propagating.  \n\ntheyre exploiting and exacerbating the situation of people who have already been indoctrinated into the belief that their love is intrinsically wrong and sinful. i dont know how these “christians” who are supposed to love and treat others as they would also like to be treated can psychologically manipulate and torment others without feeling the slightest hint of remorse or guilt. ugh.', ""Thanks for the gold!
