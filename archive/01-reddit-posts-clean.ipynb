Cause the money is stored in the card itself, the card shows its balance when boarding busses/trains/slotted into IU for cars. Issues with the system is say for example you lost the adult card, you basically lost money in it unless you remember the 16 digit CAN ID on the back of said card (since it’s anonymous), or you linked it to the EZ-Link app back in the day. This is different from Concession cards (the ones with ur IC, name and Face on it), since the authorities have more info to track said card and return the money back.\\n\\nNew SimplyGo cards are account-based cards, like your Google Drive account. The money is stored on servers with SimplyGo. I believe the data transmission to the card from servers is to strive between allowing you to board public transport and what relevant info to tell you on card reader hence you cannot see the balance (take my words with salt, I’m basing it on experience with TL Staff and observations). Also, you have to not only maintain a balance of minimum $3 (or else you can’t use the card for 2 days lol), top-ups recommends 10 minutes to update the servers (probably thought of as a small issue since you probably have to wait for a bus but still). One thing about SimplyGo is that if you lost said card and block it, you can transfer the money to your new card. But no inserting to IU, no card balance reading.\\n\\nHonestly felt that the authorities should have done a different way.\\n\\n1. Announce suspension of adult CEPAS card issuance and begin sales of only SimplyGo Cards. (They are doing the 2nd part run)\\n2. Honour remaining CEPAS cards to their Expiry\\n3. Improve the SimplyGo app, quite buggy still.\\n4. Innovate to allow card balance to be readable at the card reader.\\n\\nIf w')]"

Have you seen the posters? \"Give your car a break - take TEL3\".\\n\\nHas it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it\\'s better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/Uploads/Investor_Relations/AGM/sbst_agm_minutes_2019.pdf) that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA\\'s ridership estimates of 500k. [That it still produces losses](https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/Details/oral-reply-by-acting-minister-for-transport-chee-hong-tat-to-parliamentary-question-on-keeping-public-transport-fares-affordable) in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.\\n\\nThe high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.\\n\\nConsequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.\\n\\nIt controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA\\'s job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there\\'s not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.\\n\\nFirstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and'),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='My family (two adults, one child in pram, one in carrier) were travelling on the TEL line the other day around 7pm. We boarded the front cart, as it usually has some space for the pram. Since it was the front cart, the MRT staff was there and he kindly made space for us, so our family could stand in the corner. At some point two other people joined the staff, greeted each other and chatted to one another.\\n\\nAbout 3 stations away from our destination, our baby in the carrier started to wail. Maybe he was over-tired or over-stimulated by the smells and noises, but he became inconsolable. We fed and changed him before the journey started, but he is 6 months old, so can\\'t exactly elaborate on reasons for crying. We still did the best we could to soothe and distract him.  The MRT staff took notice and also tried to make sounds to distract our baby. **We only had about 5-6 minutes of journey left, so of course we wanted to complete it ASAP and take the baby home.** \\n\\nThen suddenly a lady who was standing with the MRT staff (I assume she might have been the MRT employee as well) turns to me and says in an **authoritative manner: \"You should stop your journey now till you soothe your baby\"**. I was so shocked I didn\\'t reply. We alighted on the next stop, since it was our destination anyways, but the encounter left me reeling... **AITA for traveling with a baby on public transport?** \\n\\nAs a parent of course I am biased to defend our right to use public transport, even if it means occasionally inconveniencing others (we do try our best not to of course). But I am curious to hear what other people think about this issue. Are we expected to rush out of the train any time our baby cries? This would add an additional burden to the already difficult task of trying to rise a child in SG. We\\'re already quite wary not to travel during peak hours, but some things cannot be helped.\\n\\nHaving kids in Singapore is hard and insanely costly and my family is in no financial position to buy a c'),\n",

I took 15 stops today and every station, instead of “ding dong next station”, I gotta hear “DINGDANGDINGDANFNNFKDHSKWHWHWHWWIAWIHW”.\\n\\nI’m also struggling to understand how this initiative is supposed to be for the visually impaired? What’s the difference between “ding dong next station” and “DINGDANGTINGDANGDINGGDADADA next station?”\\n\\nIf the issue is about the part where the train reaches the station, maybe just do it as “train approaching…paya lebar” since the default announcement when the train departs is “next station…paya lebar”.\\n\\nIt is also puzzling that this only applies to SMRT operated lines. I feel it is so not consistent because SBS operated lines like DTL and NEL won’t have them. Wouldn’t that just confuse visually impaired passengers more?\\n\\nAny thoughts?\\n\\n'),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='A while back on the more public transport-related side of r/singapore there has been one post in particular generating quite some buzz due to its highly controversial message. Unfortunately it came at a time when I was particularly committed elsewhere, hence this very late posting (the original post was published on 6th October 2023).\\n\\n[Link to original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/?share_id=e4osWcyr4HfMJLVRQAc5q&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=3)\\n\\nNonetheless it contains much dangerous confusion in public transport discourse locally which we should be aware of and steer clear from. I am in no way implying the author (or OP as I will refer to) is out with any malicious agenda, but it is good to be aware of unhelpful thinking that doesn\\'t improve public transport, and avoid it actively.\\n\\nTo tl;dr the long 990-word essay that OP has typed up, he wonders why the TEL (and DTL), despite operating in revenue service its third stage already and currently serving the CBD, is still not \"performing as well\" as expected. There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form \"sucks\" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it\\'s the case and suggest possible remedies. Unfortunately, this complex line of reasoning is riddled with fatally inaccurate assumptions, shaky logic, and prioritising the wrong things, which was why the long scholarly-appearing piece came off as offensive to many common folk who actually experience the system on a daily basis, and more critically ***rely*** on it in their lives.\\n\\nThe entire issue of underperforming rail lines, while a factual reality, has been framed entirely wrongly by OP, from the very start of the piece.\\n\\n>Has it worked?
